Intent:
The test case `testNoInlineIfParametersModified8` intends to verify that the function inlining mechanism avoids inlining when the function modifies one of its parameters, which in this case is an object (`a`). The function `f(a)` modifies the property `x` of the object `a`, and the test expects that this modification prevents inlining, preserving the object modification behavior in the output.

Repair strategy:
To resolve the issue revealed by this test case, the source code should be adjusted to detect modifications to object properties within the function. The repair should involve enhancing the condition checks within the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method to analyze whether the function body modifies any properties of its parameters. This can be done by:
1. Extending the analysis in the block where side effects are checked, to also consider assignments to object properties.
2. Adding a check that determines if any `Node` representing an object property assignment is part of the functionâ€™s statements.
3. Ensuring that any such modifications set the `hasSideEffects` flag to true, which will result in returning `CanInlineResult.NO`, effectively preventing the inlining of such functions.
