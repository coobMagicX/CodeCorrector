Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testEscapeSurrogatePairs` is to ensure that the function `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` correctly handles and escapes Unicode surrogate pairs without altering their values or splitting the characters incorrectly, preserving the integrity of multi-byte characters in a CSV format.

Repair strategy: Investigate and modify the `translate` method in the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` implementation to correctly handle surrogate pairs. Ensure that when a surrogate pair is encountered (which collectively forms a single Unicode character), the method recognizes and processes both parts of the surrogate pair together as one unit. This might involve adjusting the loop index `pos` correctly after processing a surrogate pair, ensuring it skips the entire character represented by the surrogate pair, not just one part of it. Ensure that surrogate pairs are written to the output as a single entity rather than as separate characters.
