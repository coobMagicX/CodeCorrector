Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue688` is to verify that the type annotation system correctly handles constant variable declarations that are initialized with a type-casted object literal, and to ensure that the function returning this constant variable has a consistent return type.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy involves ensuring that the `getDeclaredType` function properly resolves the types of variables declared as constants with an explicitly annotated object literal type. The source code should correctly associate the object literal with its specified type (`TwoNumbers`) in the context of the `@const` annotation. The function should be improved to handle cases where a constant is initialized with a type-casted object, ensuring that the inferred type of the constant (`SOME_DEFAULT`) is `TwoNumbers` and not `TwoNumbers|null` when used in a function return type context. This involves refining the logic that checks and assigns types to constants, particularly when those constants are initialized with type-casted object literals.
