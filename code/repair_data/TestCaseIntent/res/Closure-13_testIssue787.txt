Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue787` is to verify the correctness of the JavaScript code optimization performed by the compiler. Specifically, it checks if the compiler properly handles and optimizes scenarios involving conditional assignments and function expressions within a function.

Repair strategy: The likely source of failure could be related to improper handling of function expressions and external references during the optimization process in the `traverse` method. The repair should focus on ensuring that the traversal and modification logic in the `traverse` method accurately handles the dependencies and scopes of variables and functions, especially when they are conditionally defined. This can include improving the logic that determines whether a node should be re-traversed (`shouldRetraverse`) and the conditions under which nodes are visited (`visit`). Additionally, verifying and potentially adjusting the handling of variable scope and lifetimes during the optimization process may be necessary to ensure that the transformed code maintains functional equivalence with the original code.
