Intent: The intent of the test case `testGoogIsFunction2` is to verify that the method `caseObjectType` correctly handles different types (like numbers, strings, booleans) when determining if they can be classified or treated as functions as per Google's closure library semantics.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to properly handle and classify different JavaScript types (such as number, string, boolean) when the `value` is set to "function". The current implementation only checks if the input type is a subtype of `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE` when `value` equals "function", which might not correctly simulate the behavior expected by `goog.isFunction`. The repair should include:
1. Enhancing the logic to check against a broader range of types that might represent functions or could be coerced/considered as functions in JavaScript, reflecting the behavior of `goog.isFunction`.
2. Possibly implementing additional checks or conditions to handle other object types or primitive types that might be considered as function-like depending on the context or usage in the JavaScript environment.
