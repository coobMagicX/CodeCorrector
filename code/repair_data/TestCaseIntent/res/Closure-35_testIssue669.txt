Intent: The test case `testIssue669` is intended to verify that the function `f(a)` correctly handles type inference for an object `results` that can be dynamically assigned different properties based on condition `a`. The function should return an object that optionally includes `prop1` as an `(Object|undefined)` type, according to the JSDoc comment.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `inferPropertyTypesToMatchConstraint` method handles dynamic property assignments within conditional blocks correctly. Specifically, the method should infer properties even if they are conditionally added and not present in all branches of the function. This might involve modifying how properties are checked for existence and inferred in the `inferPropertyTypesToMatchConstraint` method, ensuring that conditional properties are recognized and properly handled even if they do not exist in all execution paths.
