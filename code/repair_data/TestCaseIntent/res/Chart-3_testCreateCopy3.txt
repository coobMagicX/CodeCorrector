Intent: The intent of the test `testCreateCopy3` is to verify that the `createCopy` method correctly creates a copy of the `TimeSeries` object for specified range indices and that the copied `TimeSeries` object accurately reflects the minimum and maximum Y values of the data items within the specified range.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the implementation of the `createCopy` method to ensure that the range of indices (`start` to `end`) are correctly handled when accessing items from the `data` list. Ensure that the method is correctly cloning and adding the items from the original `TimeSeries` data list to the new `TimeSeries` copy for the specified range, particularly checking the boundary conditions and handling of the end index. It might be necessary to verify whether the `getMaxY` method is correctly calculating the maximum value from the newly copied data items.
