Intent: The test case `testSimpleModeLeavesUnusedParams` is designed to ensure that in "SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS" mode, the source code does not remove unused function parameters. The purpose is to confirm that the behavior of the function in terms of the number of parameters (as reflected by `Function.prototype.length`) remains unchanged, even if some parameters are not referenced within the function body.

Repair strategy: The source code currently lacks a check to determine the compilation level before deciding whether to remove unreferenced function arguments. The repair should include a condition to verify the compilation level, ensuring that unused arguments are not removed when the compiler is set to "SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS". This could involve passing a configuration object or flag to the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method, indicating the current compilation level, and adding a conditional statement at the beginning of the method to return early if the level is set to simple optimizations.
