Intent: The test case `testBug1832432` is designed to verify the correct implementation of the `clone` method in the `TimeSeries` class. It checks that the cloned object is a different instance (`s1 != s2`), is of the same class as the original (`s1.getClass() == s2.getClass()`), and initially contains the same data (`s1.equals(s2)`). It also tests if modifications to the original object (`s1`) do not affect the cloned object (`s2`), ensuring that the clone is a deep copy.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that the `clone` method creates a deep copy of the `TimeSeries` object. This involves not only copying the object's immediate fields but also creating new instances of any referenced objects (like the data points in the series). The `createCopy` method used in `clone` should be checked or modified to guarantee that it does not just pass references of mutable objects contained within the `TimeSeries`. Instead, it should create entirely new instances of these objects, ensuring that changes to the original `TimeSeries` do not affect the clone.
