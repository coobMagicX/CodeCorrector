Intent: The purpose of the test case `testDontRemoveBreakInTryFinally` is to ensure that the `tryMinimizeExits` function correctly handles the scenario where a `break` statement within a `finally` block is not erroneously removed or altered, especially when it is tied to a labeled block that encompasses a `try-finally` construct. This is critical to maintaining the correct flow of control and ensuring that the semantics of the `finally` block are preserved, which should execute regardless of how the `try` block exits.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the handling of `finally` blocks in the `tryMinimizeExits` function. Specifically, ensure that the minimization process does not alter the execution flow that is essential for `finally` blocks, such as the preservation of `break` statements within them. This might involve adding conditions to check whether a `finally` block contains control flow statements like `break` or `continue` tied to labels and skipping any minimization logic in these cases. Also, verify that the scope and label context are correctly managed when evaluating and potentially modifying nodes within `finally` blocks.
