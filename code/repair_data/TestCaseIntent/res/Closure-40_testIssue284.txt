Intent: The test case `testIssue284` is intended to verify the functionality of a JavaScript inheritance mechanism using a mock library method `goog.inherits`. The test checks if the source code correctly processes the inheritance pattern where one class (`ns.PageSelectionModel.ChangeEvent`) inherits from another (`ns.PageSelectionModel.FooEvent`).

Repair strategy: Review and possibly amend the source code's handling of JavaScript's inheritance and object structures, especially focusing on how the `goog.inherits` function and object constructors within namespaces (like `ns.PageSelectionModel`) are processed. The code should ensure that it can correctly interpret and record relationships set by `goog.inherits`. This might involve enhancing the `visit` method to better handle or specifically check for patterns typical of JavaScript inheritance, such as those used by `goog.inherits`. It's also crucial to verify that the `NameInformation` and `JsName` objects are being correctly created, managed, and utilized in these contexts, particularly checking if `getName` and `recordSet` are being called appropriately for inheritance patterns.
