Intent: The purpose of the test case `testOverridingString1` is to check if the method `isValidDefineValue` correctly validates a string concatenation as a valid `@define` value. The test intends to ensure that even when a string value is constructed using binary operations (like concatenation), it is still recognized as a valid definition.

Repair strategy: Modify the implementation of `isValidDefineValue` to handle binary operations involving strings (such as concatenation) correctly. This could involve adding a case to handle the `Token.ADD` (assuming it represents concatenation in the context) and ensuring both operands of the binary operation are valid strings or valid defined values. This would entail recursively verifying the validity of both the left and right children of a node when the node type is `Token.ADD`.
