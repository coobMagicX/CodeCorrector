Intent: The test case intends to verify that the `createNumber` method can correctly parse a hexadecimal string with mixed case in the prefix ("0Xfade") and return its integer value.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle hexadecimal strings with a case-insensitive check for the prefix "0x". This can be achieved by converting the string to lowercase before checking the prefix or by using a case-insensitive comparison method. Ensure that both "0x" and "0X" prefixes are accepted equivalently in the parsing logic.
