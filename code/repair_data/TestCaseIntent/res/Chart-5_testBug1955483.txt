Intent: The purpose of the test case `testBug1955483` is to verify that the method `addOrUpdate` can manage both the updating of an existing data item and the addition of a new data item with the same x-value, when duplicate x-values are allowed (`allowDuplicateXValues` is true).

Repair strategy: The code needs to be modified to ensure that when `allowDuplicateXValues` is true, adding a new data item with an x-value that already exists in the series does not overwrite the existing item but instead adds a new entry. This involves adjusting the logic in the `addOrUpdate` method to properly handle the insertion of duplicate x-values when they are permitted. Specifically, the condition which checks `if (index >= 0 && !this.allowDuplicateXValues)` should be revised to also correctly handle the scenario where `allowDuplicateXValues` is true. This could mean adding an `else if` branch for handling duplicate allowed cases distinctly from non-duplicates.
