Intent: The test case "testUnfinishedEntity" is intended to verify if the `translate` method can correctly handle and translate numeric entities in a string even when the entity is not terminated with a semicolon (;), which is a common error in HTML or textual data. The test aims to confirm that the method will process entities like "&#x30" and convert them to their corresponding characters, in this case, the Unicode character for '0'.

Repair strategy: To make the source code pass this test case, the method should be modified to handle cases where the numeric entity does not end with a semicolon. This can be done by adjusting the logic that defines the `end` boundary of the entity parsing loop. Currently, the loop runs until a semicolon is found, but it should be updated to also consider the end of the string or a space as valid termination points for an entity. This will prevent the method from running into an infinite loop or skipping the parsing when a semicolon is absent. Additionally, ensure that proper error handling is in place to deal with any malformed entities that may occur due to these changes.
