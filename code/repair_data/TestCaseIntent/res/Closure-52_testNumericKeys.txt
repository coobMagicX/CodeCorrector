Intent: The intent of the method `isSimpleNumber` is to determine if a given string consists solely of numeric characters (digits from 0 to 9). The failed test case in the `testNumericKeys` method is checking if the method correctly handles strings that represent valid numbers but are enclosed in quotes, thus should be treated as strings rather than numbers.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isSimpleNumber` function to correctly identify and handle strings that are enclosed in single or double quotes, ensuring they are recognized as strings. This involves adding a condition to check if the string starts and ends with quotes and, if true, confirm that the content within the quotes is numeric before returning false, as it should be treated as a string in the context of the test case.
