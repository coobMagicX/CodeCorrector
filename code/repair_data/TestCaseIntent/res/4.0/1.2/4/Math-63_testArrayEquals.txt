Intent: The intent of the test cases is to check the functionality of the `MathUtils.equals` method when comparing arrays of doubles, specifically handling null arrays, empty arrays, arrays with the same values, arrays with different values, and handling special double values like NaN and infinity.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `MathUtils.equals` method only handles the comparison of single double values, but not arrays of doubles. The method needs to be overloaded or rewritten to handle arrays of doubles. This should include:
1. Checking if both arrays are null and return true if so.
2. If one is null and the other is not, return false.
3. If the arrays have different lengths, return false.
4. Iteratively compare each element in the arrays using the existing double comparison logic, including handling NaN and infinity.
5. Consider using `Arrays.equals` or a similar method for better clarity and reliability if it meets the requirement.
