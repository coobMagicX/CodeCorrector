Intent: The test case `testIssue582` is intended to check if the `addNumber` function correctly formats the number `-0.0` when it is printed in a JavaScript variable declaration statement, ensuring that it appears without unnecessary spaces around the equals sign.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that floating-point numbers, especially negative zero (-0.0), are handled correctly without introducing extra spaces in the formatting. The source code needs modification to differentiate between negative floating point numbers and negative integers in the context of preceding characters. This may involve adjusting the condition that adds a space when `x < 0` and `prev == '-'` to exclude floating point numbers like `-0.0`, or refining how floating point numbers are converted to strings and added to the output.
