Intent: The test case `testIssue1047` is intended to check that a property (`prop`) which is never defined on a constructor function (`C2`) is appropriately flagged as undefined when accessed through an instance of another constructor function (`C3`).

Repair strategy: Inspect the source code logic handling the resolution and reporting of undefined properties on object instances. Specifically, ensure that the `hasOwnProperty` method (or equivalent logic) is correctly identifying properties that are not defined in the object's prototype chain. If the method is not catching such undefined properties, the checking mechanism needs to be enhanced or corrected to accurately detect and report undeclared properties accessed via object instances. This might involve analyzing how properties are inherited and ensuring that property lookups correctly traverse the prototype chain and identify properties that are not explicitly declared.
