Intent: The test case `testIssue620` appears to be checking the functionality of the `add` method related to the correct insertion of spaces in JavaScript code involving regex patterns, specifically to ensure that consecutive slashes (`/`) in regex are handled correctly by not merging them into a single comment (which would be syntactically incorrect).

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on improving the logic within the `add` method to ensure that spaces are correctly added between consecutive regex expressions to prevent them from being interpreted as comments. Specifically, the method should be able to distinguish between regex delimiters and division operators, possibly through enhanced parsing logic or maintaining a context state that reflects whether the current slash is part of a regex or an arithmetic operation. This could involve additional checks or modifications to the handling of slashes and word characters in the code appending logic.
