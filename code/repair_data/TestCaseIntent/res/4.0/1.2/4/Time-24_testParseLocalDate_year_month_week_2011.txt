Intent: The test case `testParseLocalDate_year_month_week_2011` is intended to verify that the date parsing logic correctly interprets a string formatted as "year-month-week" into a `LocalDate` object. The test confirms that the input "2011-01-01" is parsed as the first week of January 2011, resulting in the date January 3, 2011, based on the ISO week date system.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that the date parsing logic correctly handles week-based date formats. The current logic may not be interpreting the week field correctly or adjusting the day of the week to match the first day of the specified week. The repair should include:
1. Verifying and potentially correcting the handling and interpretation of the week field (`ww`) in the date string.
2. Ensuring the calculation adjusts the parsed date to the correct day that corresponds to the first day of the given week within the specified year and month.
3. Review and possibly update the logic in `computeMillis` method to correctly integrate week-based parsing adjustments in the date computation process.
