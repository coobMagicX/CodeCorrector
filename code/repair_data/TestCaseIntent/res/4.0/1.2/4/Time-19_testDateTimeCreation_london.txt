Intent: The test case `testDateTimeCreation_london` is intended to verify the correctness of time zone handling in the `DateTime` class for London during a daylight saving time transition. Specifically, it checks if the `DateTime` object correctly represents the local time and adjusts for daylight saving time when adding an hour on the day when the clocks go back.

Repair strategy: Analyze and possibly adjust the logic in `getOffsetFromLocal` that handles the transition between standard time and daylight saving time (DST). The problem likely occurs in the handling of the DST boundary, where the offset calculation may not correctly account for the transition leading to an incorrect time representation. Ensure that the method correctly identifies and adjusts for the offset differences during the DST transition. This could involve refining the conditions under which different offsets are computed and returned, especially around the DST boundary checks and the subsequent adjustment calculations.
