Intent: The test case `testIssue810` is designed to verify that the system correctly identifies and reports an error when trying to access a property (`unknownProp`) that has not been defined on an object (`obj`). This is to ensure the robustness of property access validations within JavaScript objects, particularly focusing on handling cases where non-existent properties are referenced.

Repair strategy: The source code should include or enhance a mechanism to detect and report undeclared or undefined properties accessed on an object. Check if the `checkPropertyAccess` method or the `getJSType` method properly flags an error when an undefined property of an object is accessed. If these methods are not effectively capturing such cases, consider implementing additional checks within these methods to validate property existence before allowing access. Ensure that the validator used (`validator.expectNotNullOrUndefined`) is correctly set up to handle and report specific cases like accessing undefined properties. Additionally, review and perhaps refine how property accesses are checked against the object's declared type information to ensure that accesses of non-existent properties are reliably caught and reported.
