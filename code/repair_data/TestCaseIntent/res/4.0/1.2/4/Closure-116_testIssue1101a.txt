Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1101a` is to verify that the function `foo` which modifies external state (`modifiyX()`) and takes a parameter `a` cannot be inlined directly when called with `foo(x)`. The expected behavior is that the function should not be inlined due to side effects caused by `modifiyX()`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` function to correctly identify and handle cases where the function being checked (`foo` in this case) includes calls that modify external state or have side effects. The code should ensure that any function calls within `foo` that may have side effects (like `modifiyX()`) result in returning `CanInlineResult.NO`. This might involve enhancing the checks around `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` or `NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects` to correctly identify and factor in all kinds of side-effects or state modifications within the function body.
