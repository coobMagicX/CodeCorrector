Intent: The test case "testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass" is intended to verify that the Geometric Mean implementation in the `SummaryStatistics` class correctly calculates the geometric mean of an array of doubles when the `GeometricMean` implementation is explicitly set by the user.

Repair strategy: The failure suggests a discrepancy between the expected output from a freshly instantiated `GeometricMean` object and the geometric mean retrieved from the `stats` object. To address this, ensure that the `geoMeanImpl` field in the `SummaryStatistics` class is correctly utilized when the geometric mean is computed and returned. This might involve checking and refining the logic within the `getGeometricMean()` method to correctly use the `geoMeanImpl` instance that has been set, ensuring it calculates and returns the correct geometric mean based on the values added. Additionally, confirm that the `geoMeanImpl.increment(value)` is properly updating the state of the `geoMeanImpl` object during the `addValue` method execution. A potential issue might be that the `geoMeanImpl` object set by `setGeoMeanImpl` is not being used for calculations due to overriding or incorrect condition checks.
