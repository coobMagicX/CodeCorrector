Intent: The intent of the failing test case, `testSimpleModeLeavesUnusedParams`, is to ensure that in `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` mode, unused function parameters are not removed from the function declarations. This is to maintain the original function signature for compatibility or reflection purposes.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy involves modifying the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method to include a check for the compilation level setting. Specifically, the code should conditionally execute the removal of unreferenced function arguments based on whether the compilation level is set to advanced optimizations. If the compilation level is `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS`, the function should skip the argument removal logic. This can be implemented by adding a condition that checks the compilation level before proceeding with the removal of unreferenced function arguments.
