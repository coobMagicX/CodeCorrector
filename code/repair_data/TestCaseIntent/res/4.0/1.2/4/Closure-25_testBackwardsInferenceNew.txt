Intent: The test case `testBackwardsInferenceNew` is intended to verify that the type system correctly infers and updates the type of an object when it is passed as an argument to a constructor function that specifies a type for its parameter. The test checks if the type of variable `y` is correctly updated to match the type specified in the constructor of `F`, after `y` is passed to a new instance of `F`.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that when an object is passed to a constructor function, its type is updated based on the type annotations of the constructor's parameters. This might involve enhancing the `traverseNew` function to not only traverse and set types based on the constructor type but also to propagate the parameter type information back to the arguments if they are passed by reference. One approach could be to modify the handling of arguments in the `traverseNew` method to check if the argument types need to be updated based on the constructor parameter types, especially when dealing with objects and complex types.
