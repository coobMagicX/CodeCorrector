Intent: The test case `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is designed to verify that the `minusMonths` method correctly handles the subtraction of months from a date, especially when this leads to changes at the end of months that vary in length (such as subtracting one month from March 31 which should result in February 29 on a leap year).

Repair strategy: Inspect and potentially modify the `add` method in the source code to ensure it correctly handles end-of-month adjustments when subtracting months. This may involve adjusting the logic that calculates the new date after a month subtraction to account for month-specific day limits, particularly in cases of leap years or months with fewer than 31 days. The repair should focus on improving how the method deals with date rollovers and boundary conditions, ensuring the instant calculation and subsequent conversion back to partial values correctly reflect the altered month and day values.
