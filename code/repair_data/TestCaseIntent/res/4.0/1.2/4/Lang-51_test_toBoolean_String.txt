Intent: The intent of the `toBoolean` method is to convert various string representations of true and false into their boolean equivalents. The method is intended to handle "true", "on", "yes" in various cases (upper and lower) and combinations thereof as `true`, and all other values as `false`.

Repair strategy: The failing test case indicates that the method fails to return `false` for the string "tru", which implies there is no condition to handle strings that are not explicitly mapped to `true` but have lengths that could match those cases (lengths 2, 3, or 4). The repair should involve adding a default `return false` condition for unexpected string lengths or values within the existing length cases that do not meet the specific criteria to return `true`. This would ensure that any string that does not conform exactly to "true", "on", or "yes" (in any letter casing) is returned as `false`. The code should ensure that it handles strings of lengths 2, 3, and 4 that do not match the expected patterns by falling through to a default `false` return.
