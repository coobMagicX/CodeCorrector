Intent: The test case `testAnnotationInExterns_new6` intends to verify if methods modifying `this` within a constructor (via `new`) are correctly marked when `this` is a known local value, ensuring that such modifications are recognized without global side-effects.

Repair strategy: Modify the handling of the `NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to accurately reflect whether the constructor or associated methods modify the state in a way that affects locality. This could involve ensuring that the `callHasLocalResult` or a similar function checks if the constructor method calls modify `this` without causing global side-effects. Consider implementing a robust way to analyze the side-effects within constructor invocations and method calls on the new object.
