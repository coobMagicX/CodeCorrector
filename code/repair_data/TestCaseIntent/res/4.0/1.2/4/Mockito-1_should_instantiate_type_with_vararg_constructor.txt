Intent: The intent of the test case `should_instantiate_type_with_vararg_constructor` is to verify that a constructor with variable arguments (varargs) can be successfully instantiated using a specified resolver that provides the necessary instances for the varargs.

Repair strategy: To resolve the failing test case, the source code should correctly handle the instantiation and management of arguments for constructors that use varargs. This involves ensuring that the `captureArgumentsFrom` method in the source code properly handles scenarios where methods or constructors are called with vararg parameters. The repair should focus on:
1. Verifying that the vararg handling logic within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method correctly captures each argument of the vararg array.
2. Adjusting the instantiation logic within the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` class to properly utilize resolved vararg parameters when calling vararg constructors.
3. Ensuring that any objects resolved for varargs are correctly passed to the constructor during instantiation, potentially involving reflection or similar mechanisms to dynamically invoke constructors with variable-length argument lists.
