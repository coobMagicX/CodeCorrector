Intent: The test case `testAssignWithCall` is intended to validate the behavior of the `recordAssignment` function when an assignment involves a function expression on the right-hand side (rhs). The purpose is to ensure that the variable assignment within such a function expression correctly tracks dependencies and scopes without erroneously linking or losing reference to other variables or scopes.

Repair strategy: The source code handling for recording the dependency scope seems to not properly consider assignments where the rhs is a function expression that captures variables from an outer scope. The repair should focus on enhancing the condition checks within the `recordAssignment` method to accurately handle and record scopes when the assignment's rhs is a function or similarly complex expression. This might involve refining the logic that decides when and how `recordDepScope` is called, ensuring that the function captures external variables without misattributing their dependencies. Additionally, reviewing and possibly revising how the dependency scope is calculated in the context of such assignments will be crucial. This may require adding or modifying the conditions that check the structure and context of the parent node of the assignment, especially focusing on nested or function expression assignments.
