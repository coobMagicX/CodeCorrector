Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue303b` is to verify that function calls and property assignments within a constructor (`F`) and its methods (`setLocation`) handle the locality of references correctly, especially concerning the asynchronous callback in `setTimeout` referencing `this.location`.

Repair strategy: Check and possibly refine the handling of scope and locality inside asynchronous functions and callbacks. Specifically, ensure that the evaluation of locality in methods such as `evaluatesToLocalValue` correctly determines whether objects and their properties are local or potentially aliased, especially when accessed within asynchronous callbacks like the one used in `setTimeout`. This might involve adjusting the logic for handling `Token.GETPROP` and `Token.CALL` to correctly account for the context in which they are called and any potential aliasing effects that might occur in asynchronous operations.
