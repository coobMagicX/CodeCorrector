Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testSame("var a = String('hello', bar());");` is to ensure that the function `tryFoldSimpleFunctionCall` does not modify the call to `String` when there are additional arguments beyond the first, as transforming this could lead to unintended behaviors or incorrect results. The test aims to confirm that the function call remains unchanged in such cases.

Repair strategy: Modify the `tryFoldSimpleFunctionCall` function to check the number of arguments passed to the `String` function. The transformation from `String(a)` to `'' + a` should only occur if there is exactly one argument. If there are more arguments, the function should return the original node without any modification. This can be achieved by adding a condition to count the children of the call node and ensuring there's only one child (the first argument) before proceeding with the transformation.
