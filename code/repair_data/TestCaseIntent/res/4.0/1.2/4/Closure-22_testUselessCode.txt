Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to ensure that the source code correctly identifies and handles expressions that have no side effects, specifically preserving them when necessary rather than removing or ignoring them. This includes cases where expressions are used in positions where they might not directly affect the result but still need to be preserved for their potential effects or for correctness.

Repair strategy: 
1. Modify the node visitor logic to better handle and preserve expressions within complex statements like comma-separated lists in variable assignments or function arguments.
2. Add checks to ensure that expressions which are part of such lists are not incorrectly flagged as useless even if they do not directly contribute to a variable’s value or a function’s output.
3. Update the logic that determines whether an expression's result is used, to consider the context in which the expression is used, such as within a tuple or a list of expressions in a for-loop initialization or increment section.
4. Ensure that the preservation logic for expressions that are part of these complex structures does not rely solely on simple side-effect analysis but also considers the structural role of the expression in the code.
