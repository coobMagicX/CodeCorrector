Intent: The test case `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is intended to verify that the `add` method correctly handles the scenario where months are subtracted from a date, specifically adjusting the end of a month when subtracting leads to a month with fewer days.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the logic in the `add` method or any related utility methods to ensure that it correctly adjusts the day of the month when subtracting months results in a month with fewer days than the original month. This could involve enhancing the algorithm that calculates the new month and day values, ensuring it considers different month lengths and leap years appropriately. The specific focus should be on the calculation and adjustment of the day when the resulting month has fewer days than the original day value.
