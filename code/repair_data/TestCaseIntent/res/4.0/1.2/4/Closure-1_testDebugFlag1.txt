Intent: The intent of the test `testDebugFlag1` is to verify that the function argument `a` remains untouched when the compilation level is set to `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` and the debug flag is false. This test checks whether the code transformation respects the debug setting and the specified optimization level by ensuring that unused function arguments remain in the function definition despite being unused.

Repair strategy: The likely issue in the source code is that the function `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` does not properly check or respect the compilation level or debug settings before removing unreferenced function arguments. To address this, the repair should involve:
1. Integrating checks to assess the `--compilation_level` and `--debug` flags in the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method.
2. Ensuring that when the compilation level is set to simple optimizations and the debug flag is false, the functionality to remove unreferenced arguments is either bypassed or adjusted to retain all original function arguments as specified by the test expectations.
3. Additionally, consider improving the logic to handle different scenarios based on compilation levels more granularly, possibly by introducing a configuration or parameter that controls whether arguments should be removed, based on the compilation settings and other conditions outlined in the test case.
