Intent: The test `testTooLargeFirstStep` is designed to ensure that the adaptive step size integrator can handle very small time intervals (from 0.0 to 0.001) without exceeding these limits during the integration process. The intent is to verify that the integrator dynamically adjusts the step size to avoid stepping beyond the specified end time, thereby maintaining accuracy in stiff differential equations conditions.

Repair strategy: The primary repair should focus on improving the step size adjustment logic within the `integrate` method to ensure that the initial step size does not exceed the total time span from `start` to `end`, especially in cases where the time span is very small. This could involve modifying the `initializeStep` method or adding a condition to further restrict the initial step size based on the total interval length. Additionally, the logic for recalculating the step size (`hNew`) when the error is too large should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles scenarios with very small target times. Implementing a more aggressive control over the step size reduction in such cases may prevent overshooting the end time.
