Intent: The intent of the test case `testOverridingString3` is to verify that the method correctly handles the overriding of a defined constant with a concatenated string value. The test expects that a string constant defined with concatenation ('x' + 'y') in the source code can be overridden by a direct string assignment ("foo").

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `isValidDefineValue` does not correctly handle the case where the defined value is a binary operation involving string concatenation. To address this, the method should be enhanced to recursively validate binary operations. Specifically, the method should be updated to ensure that for binary operators like addition (used for string concatenation in JavaScript), both operands are recursively validated using `isValidDefineValue`. This will involve checking that each child node of a binary operation node is a valid define value, particularly handling cases where nodes are strings, numbers, or other valid defined expressions.
