Intent: The test case "test_stub_only_not_verifiable" aims to verify the behavior of a stub-only mock in a mocking framework. It tests that the stub returns specified values for defined inputs, and that attempting to verify interactions on a stub-only mock throws a specific exception (CannotVerifyStubOnlyMock).

Repair strategy: The failure at the line `when(localMock.objectReturningMethod(200)).thenReturn(200);` suggests an issue with handling mock interactions correctly when the method is configured to return a specific output. Verify that the captureArgumentsFrom method in the source correctly handles the arguments passed to mocked methods. Ensure that the captureArgumentsFrom method supports both capturing arguments from standard and vararg methods, and correctly identifies the types and numbers of arguments to prevent type mismatches and index out of bounds errors. If the mock framework is configured to be stub-only, ensure that it does not allow verification of interactions, as this might be causing the exception to be thrown improperly or not at all. This could involve checking the mock settings in the captureArgumentsFrom method or elsewhere in the mock handling code, to ensure proper behavior based on the configuration.
