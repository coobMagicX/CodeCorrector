Intent: The test case `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_tokyo_endOfYear` is intended to verify that the method `parseInto` correctly parses a date represented by the string `"2 29"` (February 29th) and updates a `MutableDateTime` object initially set to December 31, 2004, 23:59:59.999 in the Tokyo timezone. The test checks if the `MutableDateTime` object is correctly updated to February 29, 2004, and retains the same time and timezone settings.

Repair strategy: The error likely occurs due to incorrect parsing or timezone handling within the `parseInto` method. The line `assertEquals(4, f.parseInto(result, "2 29", 0));` fails, indicating that the position returned by `parseInto` is not as expected. This implies that either the parsing does not correctly interpret the month and day or the timezone adjustments are incorrect. To repair, ensure that:
1. The `DateTimeParser` correctly interprets and updates the month and day fields in the `DateTimeParserBucket`.
2. The timezone handling, particularly related to the computation of `instantLocal` and adjustments following parsing, maintains the intended timezone without unintended shifts.
3. Review and possibly adjust the logic that computes the new position index after parsing to ensure it correctly reflects the end position of the parsed segment within the input string.
