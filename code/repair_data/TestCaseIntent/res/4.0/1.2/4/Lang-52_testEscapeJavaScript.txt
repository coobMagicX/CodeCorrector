Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testEscapeJavaScript` is to validate the behavior of the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript` method, ensuring it correctly escapes special characters in a JavaScript string to prevent XSS vulnerabilities and syntax errors.

Repair strategy: The failed test case indicates that the method `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript` might not be escaping certain characters (`<`, `>`, `/`, and possibly others) which are crucial for preventing script injections. Since the provided source code snippet (`escapeJavaStyleString`) does not cater to these characters specifically, the repair should involve:
- Modifying the `escapeJavaStyleString` method or creating a similar method that handles additional JavaScript-specific characters such as `<`, `>`, and `/`.
- Ensuring that the method properly escapes these characters to their respective HTML or JavaScript entities (e.g., `<` to `&lt;` or to `\\x3C`).
- Adjusting the logic to account for escaping single quotes inside attributes or scripts, as indicated by the test expectation.
- Implementing comprehensive unit tests to cover various scenarios including nested quotes and mixed usage of HTML and JavaScript.
