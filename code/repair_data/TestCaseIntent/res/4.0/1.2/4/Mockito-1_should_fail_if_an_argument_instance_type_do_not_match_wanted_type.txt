Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` throws a `MockitoException` when the types of the arguments provided do not match the expected types required by the constructor. This ensures type safety and correct instantiation of objects using the constructor with resolved argument types.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the error handling in the instantiation process within `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator`. Specifically, the code should incorporate checks to validate the types of the arguments against the expected types before proceeding with instantiation. If a mismatch is detected, it should throw a `MockitoException` with a descriptive message that includes details about the mismatch, thereby preventing type errors during object creation. This will ensure the system robustly handles incorrect type scenarios, leading to more predictable and error-free behavior.
