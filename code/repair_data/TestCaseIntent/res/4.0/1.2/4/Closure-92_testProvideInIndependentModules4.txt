Intent: The test case `testProvideInIndependentModules4` is designed to check if the source code correctly handles the creation of nested namespaces across multiple modules when different parts of the namespace are provided in different modules. It aims to verify that the source code can consolidate these namespaces into a coherent structure without duplication or loss of any namespace part.

Repair strategy: The test case failure suggests that the source code might not be handling the consolidation of namespaces provided in different modules correctly. The repair should focus on ensuring that when namespaces are declared in different modules, the code correctly merges them into a single namespace object without overwriting or omitting any part of the namespace hierarchy. This might involve checking and revising the logic in the `else` block where the `replacementNode` is created and added to the code structure, ensuring that it correctly handles namespaces that span multiple modules. Additionally, reviewing the handling of `minimumModule` and its comparison with `firstModule` might be necessary to ensure that the namespace is added at the correct point in the execution.
