Intent: The test case `testRemoveGlobal2` is intended to verify whether the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method appropriately handles the removal of unreferenced function arguments when the removal of global variables is disabled (`removeGlobal = false`). The test checks if an unreferenced local variable within a function (`z` in this case) does not affect the function's arguments (`x`), ensuring that function arguments are not removed even if they are not directly used within the function body.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` function respects the setting of `removeGlobal` by not removing unreferenced function arguments when `removeGlobal` is set to false. This might involve adding a check for the `removeGlobal` flag within the method and conditioning the argument removal logic on this flag's value. Additionally, it should verify that the function's arguments are preserved irrespective of their usage within the function body when `removeGlobal` is false. This can prevent the unintentional modification of function signatures in cases where global removals are not desired.
