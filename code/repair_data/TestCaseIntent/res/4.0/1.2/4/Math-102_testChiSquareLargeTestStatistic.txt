Intent:
The test case `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is designed to verify that the `chiSquare` method correctly computes the chi-square test statistic between observed and expected frequencies, particularly for a large dataset. The purpose is to ensure the method can handle large numbers and accurately calculate the statistic, which is crucial for statistical analyses in various fields like genetics, marketing analytics, etc.

Repair strategy:
The failure in the test case suggests a potential issue with the precision or the mathematical calculation in the `chiSquare` method. The key directions for repairing the source code include:
1. Verifying the accuracy of the division and multiplication operations within the calculation loop, especially focusing on how floating-point arithmetic is handled.
2. Reviewing the formula implementation to ensure that it adheres strictly to the chi-square computation standards.
3. Implementing a more robust handling or checking mechanism for large numbers to prevent overflow or underflow, which might be distorting the test statistic calculations.
4. Comparing the implementation against a known good implementation (such as one from a reputable statistics library) to identify discrepancies and refine the calculation logic accordingly.
