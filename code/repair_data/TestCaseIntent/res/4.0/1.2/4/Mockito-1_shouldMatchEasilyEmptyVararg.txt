Intent: The test `shouldMatchEasilyEmptyVararg` is intended to verify that the method `mock.foo()` correctly handles an empty varargs scenario and returns the expected result when no arguments are passed to a method that accepts variable arguments.

Repair strategy: Investigate and revise the implementation of how `captureArgumentsFrom` handles the scenario where `invocation.getRawArguments()` returns an empty array. Ensure that the method does not throw an exception or incorrectly process matchers in the case of empty or no varargs. Additionally, verify the logic within both conditional branches (`if (invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs())` and its corresponding `else` block) to handle empty varargs properly and ensure that matchers are correctly processed or bypassed when no arguments are present.
