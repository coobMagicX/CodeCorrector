Intent: The test case `shouldVerifyBooleanVarargs()` is designed to test the proper handling and verification of method invocations with boolean varargs by the mocking framework, ensuring that the framework accurately records and verifies the correct number and values of arguments passed to vararg methods.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly handle scenarios where no varargs are passed (as with `mock.withBooleanVarargs(1);`). The current implementation may not correctly handle the case where an invocation is expected to have varargs but none are provided. Modify `captureArgumentsFrom()` to account for the possibility that the varargs array might be empty or not present at all, and ensure that the method does not prematurely throw an exception or fail to verify the method call due to incorrect assumptions about argument presence and length. This includes correcting logic to properly index and check the existence of vararg parameters and ensuring the loop and conditional structures properly account for cases with zero varargs.
