Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue291` is to verify that the method `isFoldableExpressBlock` correctly identifies foldable expression blocks in JavaScript code, specifically handling cases related to a known issue in Internet Explorer where event handlers behave differently based on the context of their return values. The test evaluates different scenarios of JavaScript conditional expressions and event handler calls within blocks to ensure they are folded correctly, adhering to specific JavaScript behaviors.

Repair strategy: Given the failure in the test case `foldSame("if (f) { f.onchange(); }");`, it indicates that the method `isFoldableExpressBlock` may not be handling the detection of foldable expression blocks correctly when it involves event handler calls like `onchange()`. The source code should be adjusted to properly recognize and handle cases where an expression block consists of an event handler, ensuring that it does not incorrectly fold such expressions which might change their behavior in certain browsers like IE. This might involve refining the logic that checks the type of expressions within a block and ensuring that the folding logic respects the nuances of JavaScript execution in different environments.
