Intent: The test case `testBigDecimal()` is designed to validate that the `EqualsBuilder` correctly handles equality comparison for `BigDecimal` objects, accounting for scenarios where `BigDecimal` objects represent the same numerical value but differ in scale or precision (e.g., "2.0" vs "2.00").

Repair strategy: Modify the `EqualsBuilder` to include a specific handling or comparison mechanism for `BigDecimal` objects. This should involve checking if the objects are instances of `BigDecimal` and using `BigDecimal`'s `compareTo` method instead of `equals` for comparison, since `BigDecimal.equals` considers two `BigDecimal` objects equal only if they are exactly the same scale in addition to being numerically equal. Implement a condition to check the instance of the objects, and if they are instances of `BigDecimal`, use `compareTo` for comparison and adjust the `isEquals` field accordingly.
