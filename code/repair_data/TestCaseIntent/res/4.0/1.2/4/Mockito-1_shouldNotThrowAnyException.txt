Intent: The intent of the test case `shouldNotThrowAnyException` is to verify that the method `foo.blah` when invoked with any string arguments does not throw any exceptions and returns the expected value (in this case, 1).

Repair strategy: The source code within `captureArgumentsFrom` method likely has issues in handling the correct number of arguments or their types when capturing arguments from the invocation. The test fails specifically at the assertion, indicating that the expected behavior of the method `foo.blah` (possibly to return 1) is not met. The likely cause could be incorrect argument handling or capturing logic within the mock setup or the method logic itself.

1. Ensure that the method `foo.blah` is correctly implemented to return the expected value under the test conditions.
2. Review and possibly refactor the logic inside `captureArgumentsFrom` to correctly handle and capture the arguments from the `invocation` object, ensuring that the logic aligns with the expected behavior of the mocked method.
3. Verify if the mock setup (`when(foo.blah(anyString(), anyString())).thenCallRealMethod()`) properly delegates to the real method and that this real method is capable of handling the inputs as expected.
4. Check for any discrepancies in how arguments are being captured or mismatches in expected versus actual method behavior, particularly focusing on how varargs and regular arguments are processed and captured.
