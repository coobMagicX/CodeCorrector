Intent: The intent of the test case `testMath283` is to verify that the `MultiDirectional.iterateSimplex` method can effectively optimize a Gaussian function to find its maximum position and value without looping indefinitely. The test aims to ensure that the simplex method of optimization converges correctly within the limits of maximum iterations and evaluations set.

Repair strategy: To prevent the infinite loop indicated by the failure, the code within `iterateSimplex` should incorporate a convergence check instead of the current `while (true)` loop that lacks termination conditions. The repair should involve adding a condition to break out of the loop when the simplex vertices no longer significantly improve or when a maximum number of iterations or evaluations is reached. This can be achieved by comparing the difference between the function values of the best points in consecutive iterations against a small epsilon value for convergence or by checking if the maximum number of iterations or function evaluations has been reached.
