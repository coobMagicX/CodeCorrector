Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue631` is to find the root of the equation `Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0) = 0` within the interval [1, 10] using the `RegulaFalsiSolver` method. The expected root value is `3.4341896575482003` with a precision of `1e-15`.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests potential issues in the root-finding implementation of `RegulaFalsiSolver`. To address this, the repair strategy should focus on verifying and potentially adjusting the numerical stability and convergence criteria in the `RegulaFalsiSolver` method implementation. This could involve checking for and handling possible precision issues in the calculation of the next approximation `x`, adjusting the function to improve numerical stability (e.g., by refining the formula used for updating `x1`, `x0`, `f1`, and `f0`), or enhancing the handling of very small differences between function values (to better accommodate the high precision requirement of `1e-15`). Additionally, ensure that the method adheres strictly to the Regula Falsi algorithm specifications, particularly how the interval updates and the function value checks are performed.
