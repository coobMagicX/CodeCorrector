Intent: The test `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` is designed to verify that the `containsIgnoreCase` method correctly handles case-insensitive string comparisons across different locales. This includes handling special case conversion scenarios that are locale-specific, such as the Turkish dotless 'i' and the German sharp 's' (ß).

Repair strategy: Modify the `containsIgnoreCase` function to handle locale-specific case conversions correctly. This could involve:
1. Utilizing `String.toLowerCase(Locale locale)` instead of `String.toUpperCase()` to ensure that the case conversion respects the specific rules of the current locale set in the JVM.
2. Review and possibly refactor the implementation to handle special cases like Turkish 'i' and German 'ß' more accurately, possibly using conditionals to detect the locale and apply specific transformations as needed. Alternatively, consider using `java.text.Collator` with the appropriate strength to handle case-insensitive comparisons without converting the strings to upper or lower case.
