Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify the correctness of the `chiSquare` method by comparing the calculated chi-square statistic to a known value computed using R, ensuring that the method calculates the statistic correctly according to the formula sum((obs - exp)^2/exp).

Repair strategy: Investigate the calculation of the chi-square statistic in the `chiSquare` method. Ensure that the method precisely follows the formula for calculating the chi-square statistic, and check for any floating-point arithmetic issues that might cause slight discrepancies. Additionally, confirm the accuracy of the expected value from R and the precision used in the `assertEquals` method. Consider increasing the tolerance if the discrepancy is due to floating-point precision limits.
