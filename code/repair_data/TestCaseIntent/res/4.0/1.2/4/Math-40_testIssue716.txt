Intent: The test case `testIssue716` is designed to evaluate the functionality of the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` in finding roots of a function that has a very sharp turn near the root. The solver is expected to accurately locate the root near -0.5, even with the sharp curvature and a function that approaches zero very slowly. It also checks that the solution complies with the condition `AllowedSolution.RIGHT_SIDE`, meaning the returned root should approximate the root from the right side.

Repair strategy: Since the test fails specifically at finding the correct root with the conditions provided, the source code may need adjustments in handling cases where the function's change is subtle and the root is approached slowly. To repair:
1. Verify and possibly enhance the precision and accuracy settings in the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` to handle functions with very small leading coefficients and sharp turns effectively.
2. Review the calculation of `nextX` in the source code to ensure it properly adjusts when encountering functions with subtle changes near the root, especially when constrained by `AllowedSolution.RIGHT_SIDE`.
3. Check and refine the convergence criteria within the solver to prevent premature convergence in cases of functions with gradual approaches to zero, ensuring that the root is bracketed correctly and the solution meets the specified side requirement (`AllowedSolution.RIGHT_SIDE`).
4. Consider implementing a more robust method of selecting interpolation points or adjusting the interpolation strategy to better handle functions with sharp turns and near-zero slopes at the root.
