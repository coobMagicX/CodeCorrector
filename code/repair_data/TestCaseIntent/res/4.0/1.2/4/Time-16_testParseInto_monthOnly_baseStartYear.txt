Intent: The test case "testParseInto_monthOnly_baseStartYear" aims to verify that the `parseInto` method correctly parses a month from a string into a `MutableDateTime` object while maintaining other components of the date-time (like year, day, hour, minute, second, and time zone) unchanged.

Repair strategy: Investigate and adjust the handling of chronology and zone updates in the `parseInto` method. Ensure that the parsed month is correctly set on the `MutableDateTime` object without altering other date-time components unintentionally. Double-check the interactions between `setMillis`, `setChronology`, and `setZone` methods, especially how they affect the internal state of the `MutableDateTime` object post-parsing. The focus should be on preserving the consistency of the date-time fields that are not intended to be modified by the parse operation. Ensure the correct chronology and time zone adjustments are applied only where necessary.
