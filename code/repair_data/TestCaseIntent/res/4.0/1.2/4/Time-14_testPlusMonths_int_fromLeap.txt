Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testPlusMonths_int_fromLeap` is to verify that adding a month to a `MonthDay` object representing February 29 in a leap year correctly results in the `MonthDay` for March 29, considering leap year date adjustments.

Repair strategy: The source code should properly handle date arithmetic involving leap years, specifically when adding months to a date like February 29 which does not exist in all years. The implementation should adjust non-existent end dates to valid calendar dates. Ensure that the method `add()` used in date computations is aware of and correctly adjusts for the leap year anomalies, particularly when the calculation spans over a non-leap year. Adjustments could include checking the validity of the resultant date and modifying the day if the month after increment does not have the original day (like February to March transition in non-leap years).
