Intent: The intent of the test is to validate that the timezone ID conversions in the `getConvertedId` method match expected mappings from legacy IDs to IANA IDs, and to ensure that these mappings are correctly utilized by the Java TimeZone and Joda-Time DateTimeZone classes.

Repair strategy: To repair the code, ensure that the `getConvertedId` method's mapping of timezone IDs is correctly updated to match the expected outputs in the failing test cases. This includes resolving discrepancies such as:
- "IET" should map to "America/Indiana/Indianapolis" instead of "America/Indianapolis".
- "IST" should map to "Asia/Kolkata" instead of "Asia/Calcutta".
- "VST" should map to "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh" instead of "Asia/Saigon".
- "MET" and "ECT" should perhaps map to "CET" if the test case expectations are correct.
- Additionally, consider adding missing mappings like "CET" directly in the `getConvertedId` mapping if it's expected to be called by the test.
- Finally, review and update any other mappings that might be outdated or incorrect as per modern standards or the test requirements.

This repair will ensure that the `getConvertedId` method returns the correct modern IANA timezone IDs as expected by the test, thereby ensuring consistency and accuracy in timezone data across different parts of the application that utilize this conversion functionality.
