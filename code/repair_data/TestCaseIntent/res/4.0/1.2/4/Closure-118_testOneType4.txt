Intent: The intent of the test `testOneType4` is to check how the code handles object literals, specifically ensuring that properties of an object defined via a prototype are accurately recognized and managed when accessed using string literals. The test seems to focus on whether properties can be set and accessed without altering their assigned types, even when manipulations are performed using different syntaxes (dot notation vs bracket notation).

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that there might be issues in the `handleObjectLit` method's ability to correctly process and recognize properties of objects, especially those defined through a prototype. The source code should be improved to:
1. Ensure that properties defined through prototypes are accurately tracked within the type system.
2. Verify the handling and tracking of property types when properties are accessed or modified using both dot and bracket notation.
3. Enhance error handling or reporting mechanisms if a property type is incorrectly accessed or an invalid operation is performed, as indicated by the presence of TODO comments which suggest incomplete error management.
4. Review and possibly refactor the logic that handles the retrieval and setting of property values, ensuring that type integrity and property definitions are maintained across different access methods.
