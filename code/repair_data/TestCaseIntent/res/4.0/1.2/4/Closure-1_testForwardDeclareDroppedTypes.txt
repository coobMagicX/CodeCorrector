Intent: The intent of the failed test cases appears to be to test the handling of function arguments and their dependencies in a JavaScript environment controlled by the Google Closure Compiler. The tests seem to focus on ensuring that the compiler correctly manages dependencies (like `goog.require` and `goog.provide`) and appropriately optimizes function arguments when type annotations and forward declarations are involved.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on ensuring that the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method does not erroneously remove function arguments that are still referenced indirectly through types or other means not directly visible in the function's argument list. This involves enhancing the logic that determines whether a function argument is referenced or not, potentially by improving the analysis of types and their relationships or dependencies declared elsewhere in the code, such as in comments or external type definitions. Additionally, ensure the compiler's error handling and reporting mechanisms adequately capture and report issues related to type dependencies and forward declarations, which may involve adjustments to how types are parsed and validated.
