Intent: The intent of the test case `shouldKnowIfObjectsAreEqual()` is to verify the functionality of the `areEqual` method, ensuring that it correctly identifies whether two given objects are equal or not. This includes handling various data types and structures such as arrays, objects, and specially handled cases like objects with potentially overridden `equals` methods.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case concerning the `badequals` object suggests issues with handling objects that may have an improperly overridden `equals` method. The `areEqual` method should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure it robustly handles objects with non-standard implementations of `equals`, possibly by catching exceptions or additional validation of the `equals` method's behavior. This might involve adding checks or using reflection to ensure the integrity and expected behavior of the `equals` method in user-defined classes.
