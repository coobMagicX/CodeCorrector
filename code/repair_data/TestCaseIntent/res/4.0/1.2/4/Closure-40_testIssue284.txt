Intent: The test case `testIssue284` is intended to validate the handling of inheritance and constructor definitions in a JavaScript-like structure using a mock function `goog.inherits`. It checks if the `visit` method properly recognizes and records inheritance relationships and constructors for nested classes.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to ensure that it can correctly handle and record inheritance relations specified by `goog.inherits`. This may include:
- Adding or improving the handling of function calls, specifically looking for the pattern used by `goog.inherits` to establish prototype inheritance.
- Ensuring that the `visit` method can detect and correctly handle nested constructor functions and their relationships as defined in the test, which might involve parsing and linking the constructor and its parent classes correctly.
- Investigating why `ns.PageSelectionModel.ChangeEvent` does not seem to be recorded or linked properly leading to the test failure, possibly due to missing or incorrect handling in the `isCall` condition or the `createNameInformation` method.
