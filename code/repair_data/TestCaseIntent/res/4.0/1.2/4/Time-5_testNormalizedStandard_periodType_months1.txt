Intent: The test case `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1` aims to validate the behavior of the `normalizedStandard` method in the context of converting a `Period` object with years and months into a normalized format using a specific `PeriodType` which only considers months.

Repair strategy: The source code should correctly handle the conversion of years to months when a `PeriodType` that only allows months is used. Implement logic in the `normalizedStandard` method to convert and aggregate years into months when the `PeriodType` does not support years. Specifically, ensure that any years in the period are converted into months and added to the existing months before constructing the final normalized `Period` object. This involves ensuring that the method checks the supported fields of the provided `PeriodType` and adjusts the period values accordingly. Adjust the arithmetic or logic of handling year-to-month conversion to account for any discrepancies observed in the test results.
