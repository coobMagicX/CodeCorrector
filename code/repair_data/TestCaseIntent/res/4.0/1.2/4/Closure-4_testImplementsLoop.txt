Intent: The test case `testImplementsLoop` is designed to verify that the system correctly identifies and reports errors when there is a cycle detected in the inheritance chain of types. Specifically, it tests the functionality that handles type resolution and cycle detection during the creation of constructors that implement their own types, which should inherently lead to a cycle.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the cycle detection logic in type resolution to ensure that it effectively catches cycles involving self-referencing types or constructors that implement themselves. This can be done by checking if the type trying to be resolved is already in the process of being resolved, thus indicating a cycle. Modifications may also be needed in how the `resolveInternal` or related methods manage the resolution state or stack to better track and identify such cycles. Additionally, ensuring that error reporting mechanisms are properly triggered when such cycles are detected is crucial.
