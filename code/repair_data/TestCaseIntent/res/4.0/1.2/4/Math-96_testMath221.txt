Intent: The test case `testMath221` is intended to check the correctness of the multiplication operation in the `Complex` class. Specifically, it tests the multiplication of two complex numbers to ensure the method correctly computes the product according to the formula for complex multiplication \((a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i\). The test case multiplies \((0 + i)\) with \((-1 + 0i)\) and expects the result to be \((0 - i)\).

Repair strategy: Investigate and correct the implementation of the `multiply` method in the `Complex` class to ensure it correctly computes both the real and imaginary parts of the product of two complex numbers. Verify that the method adheres to the formula for complex multiplication and handles cases with zero correctly. Additionally, ensure that the `equals` method can accurately compare complex numbers for equality, considering the possibility of floating-point precision issues or incorrect handling of signs in the imaginary part.
