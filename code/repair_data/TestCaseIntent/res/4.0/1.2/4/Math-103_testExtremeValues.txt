Intent: The test case `testExtremeValues` is designed to verify the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability` function of the `NormalDistribution` class for extreme values of the input argument `x`. The test ensures that as `x` moves farther from the mean (both in positive and negative directions), the cumulative probability approaches 0 for large negative values and approaches 1 for large positive values. This is to test the tail behavior of the normal distribution.

Repair strategy: Investigate the behavior of the `Erf.erf` function within the `cumulativeProbability` method, especially for large negative values of `x`. Ensure that the error function correctly handles large magnitude inputs, which can lead to numerical instability or incorrect calculations. The repair might involve implementing checks for overflow or underflow conditions, or adjusting the computational method to improve accuracy for extreme values of `x`. Additionally, ensure that `standardDeviation` is strictly positive to avoid division by zero or negative scales in the calculation.
