Intent: The intent of the test case `shouldUseEqualsToVerifyMethodVarargs` is to verify that the method `varargsObject` in a mocked interface `IMethods` is called correctly with variable arguments (`varargs`). The test checks that the method is invoked twice with the same parameters and uses `assertEquals` and `assertNotSame` to ensure reference and value equality behaviors are as expected in Java.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to correctly handle variable argument methods (`varargs`) during the capture and verification process. The following changes should be considered:
1. Ensure that the `captureArgumentsFrom` method correctly captures and compares elements of varargs when verifying method invocations.
2. Modify logic in the `if` block handling `isVarArgs()` to not throw an exception but instead properly process the varargs, capturing each argument and handling the array types accurately.
3. Review and possibly correct the verification logic in the test framework to ensure that it matches the behavior of varargs as expected and compares them correctly based on content equality rather than reference equality.
4. Implement a robust comparison mechanism for objects passed as varargs, ensuring that equality checks are based on content (deep comparison) when necessary, especially for array types. This might involve overriding or customizing the matcher used in verification to handle array comparisons appropriately.
