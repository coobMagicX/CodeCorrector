Intent: The purpose of the test `testJavaVersionAsInt()` is to validate the `toJavaVersionInt` method, which is designed to parse a Java version string and convert it to a standardized integer format. This allows for easy comparison and checking of Java versions. The test checks various formats and styles of version strings, including null and empty strings, to ensure robust handling of different input scenarios.

Repair strategy: The failure of the test case `assertEquals(0, SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt(null));` suggests that the method `toJavaVersionInt` does not correctly handle `null` inputs, which it should interpret as `0`. To repair the source code, modify the `toJavaVersionInt` method to include a check at the beginning of the method to see if the input `version` string is `null`. If it is, the method should immediately return `0`. This ensures that the method gracefully handles null inputs according to the expectations outlined in the test cases.
