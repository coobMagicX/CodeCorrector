Intent: The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to verify that the `NormalDistribution.cumulativeProbability` method can accurately handle extreme values and calculations across a range of positive and negative inputs. It checks the behavior of the cumulative probability distribution function at various scales, ensuring that the function converges correctly for very large and very small numbers, and correctly handles positive and negative infinity.

Repair strategy: The failure indicated by the stack trace suggests that the method does not return the expected result when `Double.MAX_VALUE` is passed as `x`. The method should return a cumulative probability of 1 when `x` is `Double.MAX_VALUE`, as this represents a value far in the upper tail of the distribution. To address this:

1. Review and possibly adjust the handling of extremely large values within `cumulativeProbability`. Ensure that calculations do not lose precision or incorrectly calculate probability due to floating point limitations or errors in the erf function implementation.
2. Improve or replace the error function (Erf.erf) used, as it might not handle extreme values (`Double.MAX_VALUE`) correctly. Consider using or creating a more robust mathematical function that can handle such extremes.
3. Add explicit checks for `Double.MAX_VALUE` and `Double.MIN_VALUE` to return 1 and 0 respectively, before more complex calculations are performed, to avoid unnecessary processing and potential errors.
4. Ensure that the method is robust against edge cases by implementing additional boundary tests and considering edge cases in the error handling logic.
