Intent: The test case `shouldVerifyObjectVarargs()` is designed to validate that the method `withObjectVarargs` of a mock object is correctly processing variable arguments (varargs) and ensuring that no unexpected interactions are performed after the specified verifications.

Repair strategy: The issue likely originates from improper handling of variable argument methods in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. Specifically, the test fails at the verification step, suggesting that either the arguments aren't captured correctly or the matcher logic does not properly handle scenarios with different numbers and types of arguments.

1. Review and adjust the `captureArgumentsFrom` method to ensure it correctly processes both fixed and variable number of arguments. This involves:
   - Ensuring that the method captures each argument individually when varargs are not used, and appropriately when varargs are used.
   - Correctly determining whether a method uses varargs (`invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs()`) and processing them correctly by capturing each element of the vararg array.
   - In the loop where matchers are processed, ensure that the array elements of varargs are correctly processed and captured by the respective matchers.

2. The exception `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown unconditionally when a method with varargs is detected. This should either be removed or handled differently to allow further processing of varargs.

3. Ensure that the `return` statement after processing varargs does not prematurely exit the method, potentially skipping necessary processing for subsequent matchers or arguments.

By addressing these points, the method should be able to handle both normal and variable arguments correctly, allowing the test case to pass.
