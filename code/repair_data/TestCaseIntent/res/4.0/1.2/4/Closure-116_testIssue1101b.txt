Intent: The test `testIssue1101b` intends to verify that the method `canInlineReferenceDirectly` correctly identifies scenarios where function inlining should not occur due to side effects associated with the function's parameters. Specifically, the test checks that a function (`foo`) which modifies a property of an object (`x.prop = 2`) and then returns a parameter (`a`) should not be inlined when called with an argument that involves the same object property (`foo(x.prop)`).

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that it can detect and handle cases where the arguments passed to a function call might be affected by side effects within the function itself, particularly when the argument is a property access that is also modified within the function. The repair should involve enhancing the check around the condition where the function parameters and call arguments are analyzed to correctly recognize and block inlining when the function's operations could alter the state of an argument passed to it. This involves refining the logic that checks for side effects and mutable state interactions between function parameters and arguments.
