Intent: The test case `testIssue937` appears designed to validate the transformation or optimization of JavaScript code involving complex expressions and type casting. The code involves calling a method on an instance created via a constructor (`new x()`) and accessed via a computed property (`['abc']`). The intent is to ensure that after optimization, the code still behaves as expected without losing any semantic meaning or functionality.

Repair strategy: Analyze the `annotateCalls` method to ensure that it correctly handles and maintains the context of method calls, especially those involving constructed objects and type annotations. Verify that property accesses (like `['abc']`) on newly created objects (`new x()`) inside type-casted function calls are preserved correctly during the optimization process. This might involve enhancing the handling of computed properties and ensuring that type information does not lead to incorrect assumptions about method calls in the optimization logic.
