Intent: The test case `testLANG805` is intended to generate a string composed of three 'a' characters using a specified array of characters `{ 'a' }`, with both letters and numbers flags set to false, and start and end bounds set to 0.

Repair strategy: The issue stems from how characters are chosen and validated within the `random` method. The method mishandles the combination of the specified character array along with the start and end indices. Since `start` and `end` are both set to 0, and only 'a' is allowed, the calculation of index and character selection from the array is incorrect. The repair should involve correcting how indices are calculated when `chars` is not null and ensuring the character selection correctly refers to elements within the bounds of the `chars` array. Additionally, ensure that the condition to increment `count` when an invalid character is selected should consider the specifics of using a custom `chars` array. Adjust the character selection logic to correctly handle the custom character array and ensure characters are chosen based on their index within the array, not using the `gap` calculation which is designed for ASCII range selections.
