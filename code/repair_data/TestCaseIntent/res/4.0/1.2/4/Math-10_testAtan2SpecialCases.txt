Intent: The test case `testAtan2SpecialCases` is designed to verify the correct behavior of the `atan2` function when handling edge cases involving zero and negative zero values in both arguments. This is important for ensuring mathematical accuracy in computations that could involve these edge cases.

Repair strategy: The code should specifically handle cases where both x and y values are zero or negative zero. The current implementation may not correctly distinguish between +0.0 and -0.0, and it might not be handling the sign of zero results correctly. To address this:
1. Add explicit checks in the `atan2` function to handle combinations of +0.0 and -0.0 for both x and y arguments.
2. Ensure that the sign of the result is correctly set according to the signs of x and y, especially when both are zero.
3. Consider utilizing or verifying against Java's built-in `Math.atan2` for expected behavior or as a reference for special case handling.
4. Adjust the handling of the result array filling, ensuring that all paths correctly compute or copy the necessary values, particularly for the initial element which seems to be specifically failing according to the provided stack trace.
