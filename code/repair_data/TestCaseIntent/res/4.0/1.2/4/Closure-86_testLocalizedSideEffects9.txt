Intent: The test case `testLocalizedSideEffects9` is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies localized side effects in JavaScript code. It specifically tests the scenario where a local object is created and modified within a function, and then returned, ensuring that this local manipulation does not count as a global side effect.

Repair strategy: The issue likely resides in the handling of objects created with the `new` operator within the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method. The method should be able to ascertain whether the returned object from a constructor function is truly local (i.e., not aliased or globally accessible elsewhere). To repair the source code, enhance the logic for the `Token.NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method to check if the constructed object is indeed local and unaliased throughout its scope. This may involve tracking the object's references post-construction or refining the conditions under which an object is considered local.
