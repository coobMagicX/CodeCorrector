Intent: The test case `testBug545` intends to verify that the `replaceAssignmentExpression` method correctly handles the initialization and assignment of an empty object to a variable, and ensures the transformed expression evaluates to `true` when expressed in terms of a JavaScript expression.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to ensure that when an object literal is assigned to a variable, the expression handling in `replaceAssignmentExpression` correctly forms a truthy value (`true`) as the final result of the entire expression, especially in scenarios where the object literal is empty (i.e., `{}`). This may involve adjusting how nodes are handled and ensuring the logic correctly interprets an empty object literal in such a way that the overall expression evaluates to `true` as expected by the test case. The handling of the `Token.TRUE` node and its placement in the node tree should be specifically reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure the correct evaluation outcome.
