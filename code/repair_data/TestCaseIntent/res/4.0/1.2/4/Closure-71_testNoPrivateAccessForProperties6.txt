Intent: The test case `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties6` intends to ensure that a private property of a superclass cannot be overridden as a non-private property in a subclass, particularly when the subclass is defined in a different source file. This is to uphold the encapsulation principles of object-oriented programming related to private member access.

Repair strategy: To address the failure of this test case, the source code must be adjusted to include a check that validates whether an overridden property in a subclass correctly respects the privacy level of the corresponding property in the superclass. Specifically, the code should verify that if a private property in the superclass is being overridden in a subclass, the overriding property must maintain the 'private' status if it is in a different file. The repair should involve:
1. Ensuring that `overridingVisibility` correctly retrieves and checks the visibility status of the overriding property.
2. Adding a condition to handle cases where the superclass and subclass are in different files, and the overridden property visibility is not private when it should be.
3. Enhancing the error reporting mechanism to clearly indicate the type of visibility mismatch in cases of cross-file inheritance and overriding scenarios.
