Intent: The test case `should_report_failure_if_constructor_throws_exception` is designed to ensure that the system properly handles and reports an exception thrown by a constructor during instantiation. This test aims to verify that the system can gracefully handle constructor failures and provide a meaningful error message indicating the issue.

Repair strategy: The source code likely lacks adequate exception handling and error messaging when a constructor throws an exception during the instantiation process. The repair should focus on implementing or improving exception handling in the instantiation process. This would involve catching exceptions thrown by the constructor, logging or storing the exception details, and then rethrowing a higher-level exception (such as `MockitoException`) that includes a descriptive error message. This approach would ensure that users receive a clear, understandable message when a constructor fails, enhancing the robustness and user-friendliness of the system.
