Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testRecursiveRecord` is to verify the proper handling of recursive or self-referential object types within the `toStringHelper` method. The test aims to ensure that when an object type references itself, it is accurately represented in the string output with placeholders for recursive types, and that different string representations (such as for annotations) are handled correctly.

Repair strategy: The likely source of failure is that the `toStringHelper` method does not correctly handle or detect recursive references in object types, leading to incorrect or incomplete string representations. To repair this:

1. Introduce a mechanism to detect recursive references within the object types. This could be implemented by maintaining a set of visited object types during the string construction process.
2. When a recursive reference is detected, instead of attempting to expand the object type further, insert a placeholder (e.g., `{...}` or `?`) to indicate the recursive reference.
3. Ensure that this detection and placeholder insertion logic is applied consistently across different string representation methods (like `toString` and `toAnnotationString`).
4. Modify the `toStringHelper` or related methods to handle recursive structures appropriately by using the visited set to check if the current object has been processed before in the recursive call stack, thereby preventing infinite loops and stack overflow errors.
