Intent: The test case `testParseLicenseAscii` aims to verify that the parser correctly extracts and preserves the formatting of a multiline license comment from a JSDoc string, including spaces and newlines between the text segments.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that the extraction logic properly handles and preserves line breaks and multiple spaces when reading license text in comments. The repair should focus on the handling of `WhitespaceOption` settings, particularly when `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` is set, to ensure that spaces and line breaks within the JSDoc comments are not lost or improperly handled during the parsing process. Additionally, adjustments might be necessary in the way `ignoreStar` and token processing logic is handled to ensure stars and spaces are correctly interpreted and preserved according to the comment's original formatting.
