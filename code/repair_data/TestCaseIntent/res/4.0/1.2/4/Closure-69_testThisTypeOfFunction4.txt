Intent: The intent of the test case `testThisTypeOfFunction4` is to verify that methods defined on the prototype of a constructor function, such as `moveTo` and `lineTo`, are correctly handled when called conditionally using a ternary operator based on the loop index. The test ensures that the `this` type is correctly bound and that such function calls are valid in the context of the object created from the constructor function `F`.

Repair strategy: The source code should be enhanced to handle cases where function methods are accessed conditionally (e.g., using ternary operators) and ensure that the `this` type binding is properly validated in such scenarios. This would involve checking whether the function being called has a specific `this` type defined and if the context of the call matches this type, particularly when functions are accessed in a non-direct manner (such as through a conditional expression). The repair should ensure that the `this` type is correctly associated with the function call regardless of how the reference to the function was obtained.
