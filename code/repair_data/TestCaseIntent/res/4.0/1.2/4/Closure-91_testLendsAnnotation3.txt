Intent: The test case `testLendsAnnotation3` intends to verify that the method `shouldTraverse` correctly handles the traversal of a function declaration within an object literal that is annotated with `@lends`, especially when the object literal lends its members to a constructor's prototype.

Repair strategy: Modify the `shouldTraverse` method to ensure it properly handles scenarios where an object literal's methods (annotated with `@lends`) are being assigned to a prototype. This could be achieved by checking for the `@lends` annotation in the JSDoc of the node or its related parent nodes and allowing traversal if this annotation is present. This involves refining the logic that handles the parsing and interpretation of JSDoc annotations and their associated semantics, especially in relation to prototype assignments in JavaScript.
