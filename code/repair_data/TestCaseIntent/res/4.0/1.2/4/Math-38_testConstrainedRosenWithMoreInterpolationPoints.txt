Intent: The purpose of the test case `testConstrainedRosenWithMoreInterpolationPoints` is to validate the optimization algorithm's ability to handle a predefined number of interpolation points without exceeding the calculated maximum for a given dimension (`DIM`). It aims to ensure that the optimizer correctly handles varying numbers of interpolation points up to a calculated maximum and finds the minimum of the Rosenbrock function within the specified constraints.

Repair strategy: The error likely arises from the miscalculation or mishandling of interpolation points or the limits within the `prelim` method, particularly in how it initializes and utilizes the interpolation points matrix (`interpolationPoints`). The repair should focus on ensuring that the `interpolationPoints` matrix is properly managed for all values up to and including the maximum limit. This could involve reviewing and potentially adjusting the logic that sets up and manages the size and values of the `interpolationPoints`, `bMatrix`, and `zMatrix`. Additionally, ensure that the calculation of maximum allowable interpolation points aligns with the logic and constraints defined within the code, particularly where the test fails. Adjustments might be needed in how interpolation points are initialized or in how the bounds (`lowerBound` and `upperBound`) are enforced during the optimization iterations.
