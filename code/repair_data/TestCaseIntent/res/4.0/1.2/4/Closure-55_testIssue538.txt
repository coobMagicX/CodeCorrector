Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testIssue538` is to ensure that the implementation of `isReduceableFunctionExpression` correctly identifies whether a given node within a code snippet is a function expression that can be reduced or simplified. The test seems to focus on getter methods in a prototype object to verify if these are recognized properly by the function.

Repair strategy: The source code currently only uses `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)` to determine if a node is a reducible function expression. The failure in the test case suggests that this utility method may not be correctly identifying getter methods (or similar constructs) as function expressions. The repair should involve enhancing the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method to properly recognize and handle different types of function expressions including getters, setters, and potentially other similar constructs that are not being currently detected. This might involve extending the current utility function or integrating additional checks specific to these cases.
