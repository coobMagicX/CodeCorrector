Intent: The test `testStringCreateNumberEnsureNoPrecisionLoss` is designed to ensure that the `createNumber` method correctly identifies and creates numbers of specific types (Float, Double, BigDecimal) based on their format and value, preventing any precision loss during the type allocation.

Repair strategy: Investigate and adjust the logic in the `createNumber` method to correctly interpret and manage floating point numbers and their representation limits. Specifically, ensure that the method can differentiate between Double and BigDecimal based on the precision and range of the input string. Modify the condition checks and parsing logic to handle scientific notation correctly and ensure that numbers which exceed the range of Double are instantiated as BigDecimal. Consider revising how exponentials (e.g., 'e' or 'E') are handled and parsed to correctly allocate the number type based on its value and precision requirements.
