Intent: The test `test_getOffsetFromLocal_Moscow_Autumn_overlap_mins` is designed to verify the `getOffsetFromLocal` function during the autumn daylight saving time (DST) transition in Moscow when the clocks are set back, creating a one-hour overlap. The test checks that the function correctly handles each minute within the hour that the clocks are set back, ensuring that the offset is accurately calculated during this period of overlap.

Repair strategy: The source code likely fails to handle the scenario of the DST transition where the same local time occurs twice, each with potentially different UTC offsets. Since the issue arises in the test during the overlap period, the function `getOffsetFromLocal` needs a more robust mechanism to determine which of the two possible offsets applies to a given local time during the DST rollback. One approach is to enhance the logic that decides when to return `offsetLocal` vs `offsetAdjusted`. Specifically, the condition when `(offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0` might need refinement to better handle negative offsets or to correctly identify and apply the transition rules for the timezone in question (Moscow in this case). This might involve adjusting the logic to check the relationship between `nextLocal` and `nextAdjusted` or explicitly handling the cases of time during the overlap more carefully.
