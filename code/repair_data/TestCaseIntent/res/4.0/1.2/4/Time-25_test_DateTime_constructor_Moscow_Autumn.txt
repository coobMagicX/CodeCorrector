Intent:
The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the `DateTime` constructor correctly handles the transition of Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the Moscow time zone during autumn. Specifically, it checks whether the constructed `DateTime` object accurately represents the local time and offset on a day when the DST adjustment would have occurred.

Repair strategy:
The potential issue lies in how the `getOffsetFromLocal` method handles the adjustment for the DST change. The test failure suggests that the offset is not correctly calculated during the DST transition, potentially due to incorrect logic in determining whether the time is before or after the DST change, or mishandling of the transition boundary. 

To repair this:
1. Review and possibly revise the logic that checks the difference between `offsetLocal` and `offsetAdjusted` to ensure it correctly identifies and handles the DST transition.
2. Verify the conditions under which `nextTransition` is called and ensure that it returns the correct transition time for both positive and negative offsets.
3. It may also be necessary to adjust the logic for calculating `nextLocal` and `nextAdjusted` to ensure they correctly reflect the transition time in relation to the adjusted offsets.
4. Add or refine unit tests specifically around the edge cases at DST boundaries to ensure the `getOffsetFromLocal` method handles these correctly.
