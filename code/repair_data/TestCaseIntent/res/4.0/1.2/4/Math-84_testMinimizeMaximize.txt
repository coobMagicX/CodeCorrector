Intent: The test case `testMinimizeMaximize()` is designed to verify that the optimizer can correctly find both local minima and maxima of a function that has multiple extrema. The test checks the accuracy of the found extrema points and their corresponding function values, as well as ensuring that the number of function evaluations stays within an expected range.

Repair strategy: The failure indicated by `Assert.assertTrue(optimizer.getEvaluations() < 150);` suggests that the optimizer is performing more evaluations than expected, which could be due to inefficient convergence or unnecessary iterations. To repair this, consider the following strategies:
1. **Improving Convergence Criteria:** Adjust the convergence checker parameters to better suit the problem's characteristics, potentially making the criteria more strict.
2. **Optimizing Algorithm Steps:** Review and optimize the steps in the `iterateSimplex` method - particularly look into the conditions under which the reflected and expanded simplexes are accepted or rejected, and ensure that the algorithm isn't stuck in unnecessary loops or repeatedly evaluating suboptimal points.
3. **Enhancing Efficiency of Simplex Evaluations:** Ensure that the evaluations of new simplexes (reflected, expanded, contracted) are efficiently calculated to avoid redundant calculations and checks.
4. **Debugging Logical Errors:** Check for any logical errors in the simplex manipulation logic that might cause excessive iterations, such as incorrect updating of the simplex or not properly exiting loops when optimal conditions are met.
