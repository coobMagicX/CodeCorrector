Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify that the `multiply` method correctly computes the product of a `Dfp` object and another `Dfp` object or an integer. The tests include basic multiplication, multiplication by zero, multiplication involving positive and negative infinity (`pinf` and `ninf`), multiplication involving NaN (Not a Number), and cases of potential overflow and underflow.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `multiply` method is capable of handling multiplications involving large numbers that might lead to overflow. In the provided source code, the `multiply` method calls `multiplyFast(x)`, but it's unclear how `multiplyFast` is implemented or if it correctly handles cases like multiplication by `10000`. The repair should include:
1. Verifying or implementing proper handling of large integer values in `multiplyFast(int x)` or the `multiply(Dfp d)` method.
2. Checking if the method properly scales or handles scenarios that might result in overflow, potentially adjusting the implementation to accommodate such large values or to flag an overflow condition correctly.
3. Ensuring that type conversions between integers and Dfp objects maintain precision and value correctly.
