Intent: The test `testDependencySortingWhitespaceMode` is intended to validate that the source code correctly manages and sorts dependencies while in WHITESPACE_ONLY compilation mode. It specifically checks if the source can handle and reorder the provided and required namespaces (`goog.provide` and `goog.require`) as expected.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on investigating and possibly modifying the `manageDependencies` method inside `JSModuleGraph`. Check if the dependency sorting logic correctly interprets and processes the `--compilation_level=WHITESPACE_ONLY` setting. Ensure that this method can accurately detect and manage the dependencies specified by `goog.provide` and `goog.require` in a way that aligns with the test's expectations. Debug and adjust the handling of dependency orders to ensure they match the test case requirements under the specific compilation settings.
