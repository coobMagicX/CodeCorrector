Intent: The test case `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` aims to verify that the `SummaryStatistics` class correctly calculates and returns the mean of an array of numbers when the mean calculation is explicitly overridden using a custom implementation (in this case, using the `Mean` class directly).

Repair strategy: The failure suggests a possible issue with how the overridden implementation is integrated or how it calculates or stores the mean value. The first step is to ensure that when a new `Mean` instance is set using `setMeanImpl`, this instance is properly used during the calculation in `addValue`. Furthermore, verify that the `getMean()` method correctly retrieves the mean from the `meanImpl` instance rather than using any default or incorrectly cached values. This might involve ensuring that the `meanImpl` object is correctly updated in each call to `addValue` and that no other part of the code incorrectly modifies or fails to consider this overridden implementation. A thorough review and potential refactoring of how overridden implementations are handled in the `addValue` method could resolve the issue.
