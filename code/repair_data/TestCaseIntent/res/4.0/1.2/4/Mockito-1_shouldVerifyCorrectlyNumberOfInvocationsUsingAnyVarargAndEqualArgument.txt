Intent: The intent of the failed test case, `shouldVerifyCorrectlyNumberOfInvocationsUsingAnyVarargAndEqualArgument`, is to ensure that the `newRow` method of the `table` object is called exactly two times with the first argument equal to "x" and the subsequent arguments can be any number of string varargs. The test aims to validate the correct handling and verification of variable-length argument methods in the system.

Repair strategy: The source code should be examined and potentially modified to ensure that variable arguments (varargs) are correctly handled and captured when verifying method invocations with expectations involving varargs (`anyVararg()`). The error in the test case implies a potential issue in the handling or capturing of varargs in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. Specifically, the method might not be properly capturing the varargs when mixed with other types of matchers (like `eq("x")` with `(String[]) anyVararg()`). The repair should focus on ensuring that when `isVarArgs()` returns true, the method accurately handles each element within the varargs array rather than throwing an `UnsupportedOperationException`, and integrates these correctly with other argument matchers. Additionally, the source code should ensure that the varargs are correctly counted and matched against the provided vararg matchers, thus allowing the verification logic to properly count invocations with varying numbers and types of arguments.
