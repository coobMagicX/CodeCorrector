Intent: The test case `testDoubleInlining1` intends to verify whether the function `foo` can be inlined into the function `bar` when `bar` is passed as an argument to `foo`. The purpose is to confirm that the inlining process correctly handles chaining of function calls and propagates the argument `x` through both functions to ultimately call `getWindow(x)`.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to properly handle the inlining of a function (`bar`) that is itself an argument to another function that is being inlined (`foo`). The inlining logic should ensure that when a function passed as an argument is itself a function call, it correctly treats the argument of the outer function as the parameter of the inner function. This requires careful handling of argument propagation and function parameter mapping during the inlining process:
1. Ensure that function parameter references are correctly updated during inlining when functions are chained.
2. Review and possibly modify the logic that checks for side effects and mutable state to ensure that it does not incorrectly prevent inlining in cases where inlining should be feasible.
3. Confirm the logic that handles the `this` keyword and method calls like `call` and `apply` to ensure they don't interfere with straightforward function call inlining.
