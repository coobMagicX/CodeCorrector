Intent: The test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning4` is designed to verify that the `handleBlockComment` method correctly identifies and reports warnings for block comments that are likely to be incorrectly formatted JSDoc comments. Specifically, it tests for a comment containing `@type` which should have been flagged as suspicious given that it starts with `/*` instead of `/**`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `handleBlockComment` method to accurately identify suspicious block comments regardless of whitespaces or newlines before the JSDoc-like annotations (`@`). The current implementation may not correctly handle cases where there are spaces or different newline characters before the `@` symbol. The method's condition to detect `@` annotations should be enhanced to account for variations in whitespace and newline characters within the block comment.
