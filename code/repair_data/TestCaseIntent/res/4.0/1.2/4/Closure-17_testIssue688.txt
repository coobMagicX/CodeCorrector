Intent: The test case `testIssue688` is intended to verify that the JavaScript type-checker correctly identifies and enforces the declared type of a constant variable (`SOME_DEFAULT`) initialized with an object literal annotated with a specific type (`TwoNumbers`). The test further checks whether the type of `SOME_DEFAULT` is correctly inferred as `TwoNumbers` and not `null` or any other type when used in a function that expects a specific return type (`number`).

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to ensure that it correctly handles the type inference for object literals annotated with a custom interface type. The method `getDeclaredType` should be able to accurately determine and return the correct JavaScript type (`TwoNumbers` in this case) for variables declared with `@type` annotations, especially when they are initialized directly with object literals. Specifically, the handling of `rValue.isObjectLit()` within the context of `info.hasEnumParameterType()` might need adjustment or enhancement to correctly interpret custom interface types, not just enums. Additionally, consider refining the logic that determines when to use `getDeclaredTypeInAnnotation`, ensuring that it appropriately handles all cases where the type is explicitly annotated, whether it's a constant, a function, an enum, or an interface.
