Intent: The intent of the test case `assertTrue(testValidDefineValue("1 + 8"));` is to verify that the method `isValidDefineValue` correctly handles and validates expressions involving addition of two numbers, returning true since both operands are valid numbers.

Repair strategy: The source code currently checks only specific binary operators (BITAND, BITNOT, BITOR, BITXOR) and unary operators (NOT, NEG) for the validity of their operand nodes. The addition operator (PLUS), used in the failing test case, is not handled in the switch case statement in the `isValidDefineValue` method. To repair this, you need to add a case for `Token.PLUS` in the switch statement that handles binary operators, ensuring it checks the validity of both children, similar to how BITAND, BITOR, etc., are handled. This should also be applied to other arithmetic and logical operators that might have been overlooked but are implied to be supported based on the test cases (e.g., MINUS, TIMES, DIV).
