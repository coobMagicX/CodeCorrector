Intent: The intended purpose of the test case `testNoStringJoin` is to verify that the `tryFoldArrayJoin` method correctly handles cases where the `.join()` method is called with parameters that should not trigger any transformations. Specifically, it tests that arrays with non-string join parameters or multiple parameters do not result in any code folding or modifications.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should involve revising the condition checks in the `tryFoldArrayJoin` method to ensure that it only proceeds with folding when the `.join()` method is called with exactly one argument and that argument is either absent (implying the use of a default comma) or is a valid, single immutable value (e.g., a string). Any other scenarios, including multiple arguments or non-immutable values, should result in the method exiting early without modifying the node structure. This can be achieved by tightening the validation logic around the input parameters of the `.join()` method within the source code.
