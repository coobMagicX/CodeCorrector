Intent: The test case `testNoInlineIfParametersModified9` is designed to verify that the function `canInlineReferenceDirectly` correctly identifies that a function should not be inlined if it modifies one of its parameters. The function in question modifies an array element, which should prevent it from being inlined because this is a side effect that affects the state of the argument passed to the function.

Repair strategy: Adjust the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method to ensure that modifications to array or object properties (via assignments in parameter usage) are correctly identified as side effects. This involves enhancing the side effect detection logic specifically for cases where parameters are objects or arrays that get modified within the function. This could include checking for assignments or other modifications to properties of parameters passed to the function.
