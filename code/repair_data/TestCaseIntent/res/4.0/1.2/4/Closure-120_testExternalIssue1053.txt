Intent: The test `testExternalIssue1053` likely aims to verify that the method `isAssignedOnceInLifetime()` correctly determines whether a variable `u` is assigned only once during its lifetime, even when used recursively within a function.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to more accurately track and handle the scope and re-assignments of variables, especially in recursive function calls. This can be done by:

1. Implementing or enhancing a mechanism to check if the variable `u` is reassigned within the same function scope, including recursive calls.
2. Adjusting the logic in the loop that checks the type of `BasicBlock` to consider recursive function scenarios as a special case.
3. Improving how function calls and their effects on variable assignments are handled, potentially by maintaining a stack or history of assignments within each function call.
