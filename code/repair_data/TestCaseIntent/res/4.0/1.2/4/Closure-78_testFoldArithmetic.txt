Intent: The `performArithmeticOp` method is intended to perform arithmetic operations based on the operator type (`opType`) and operands (`left`, `right`). It handles various operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise operations. Special conditions are considered, such as division by zero and string representations of arithmetic results.

Repair strategy: The failed test case `fold("x = 1 / 0", "x = 1 / 0")` suggests that the current implementation incorrectly handles cases where the division by zero should ideally propagate the error or maintain the expression as-is instead of returning null or throwing an error explicitly. The repair should involve adjusting the behavior for division by zero to match the expected output as shown in the test case, possibly by allowing the method to return a special representation (like a Node with an error message or the original division expression) instead of null or throwing an error directly. This can be accomplished by modifying the error handling logic for the `DIV` case in the switch statement to instead create and return a node that keeps the division by zero expression intact as per the test assertion.
