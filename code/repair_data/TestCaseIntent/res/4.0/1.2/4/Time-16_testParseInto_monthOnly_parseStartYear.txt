Intent: The test `testParseInto_monthOnly_parseStartYear` is designed to verify that the `parseInto` method correctly parses a single month input ("1" for January) and updates the `MutableDateTime` object appropriately. The test checks if the month is set to January without altering other components of the date-time object (year, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and timezone).

Repair strategy: Review and modify the `parseInto` method to ensure that it correctly interprets the month from the input string and updates only the month field of the `MutableDateTime` instance while preserving other date and time fields (especially when only a single date component, such as the month, is parsed). The problem likely lies in how the date components are being reset or not preserved when parsing and setting new date and time values. Ensure that the parser bucket's computed millis (from `bucket.computeMillis()`) does not incorrectly reset other date-time components that are not specified by the input string.
