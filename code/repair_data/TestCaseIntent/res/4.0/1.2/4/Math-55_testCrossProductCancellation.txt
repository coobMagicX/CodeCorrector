Intent: The test case `testCrossProductCancellation` is intended to verify that the `crossProduct` method can accurately compute the cross product of two vectors, even when the vectors have large or small values, and when they are close in magnitude which could potentially lead to numerical cancellation errors. The test checks for both normal-sized vectors and vectors scaled by a large factor, to ensure precision is maintained in different scenarios.

Repair strategy: The provided source code suggests an approach to reduce cancellation errors by preconditioning vectors before computing the cross product, but it lacks implementation of this approach. The key repair direction should involve completing the implementation of the error reduction strategy. Specifically:

1. Implement the computation of `rho` as an approximation of `v1.dot(v2) / v2.dot(v2)`.
2. Use `rho` to adjust `v1` before computing the cross product, by setting `v3 = v1 - rho * v2`.
3. Compute and return the cross product using `v3` and `v2` instead of `v1` and `v2`.

This strategy aims to minimize the effect of numerical precision issues that can arise due to the subtraction of nearly equal numbers, which is what the failed test case seems to expose.
