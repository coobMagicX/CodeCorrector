Intent: The purpose of the test case `testGoogIsFunction2` is to verify that the method `testClosureFunction` correctly identifies and handles JavaScript functions, especially when dealing with types like `OBJECT_NUMBER_STRING_BOOLEAN` and `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`. It likely aims to ensure that the `caseObjectType` method in the source code appropriately classifies object types, particularly distinguishing between functions and general objects.

Repair strategy: To repair the source code:
1. Ensure that the `value` variable used in the `caseObjectType` method is correctly set and interpreted before the method is invoked, especially examining its handling of different object types such as "function".
2. Verify and possibly refactor the condition `value.equals("function")` to ensure it comprehensively includes all relevant function types or patterns expected in the test, including edge cases or variations like `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`.
3. Review and adjust the logic of `matchesExpectation("object")` to accurately return `type` when the type should be recognized as an object but not specifically a function, ensuring that the method does not incorrectly filter out or misclassify object types under the tested conditions.
4. Investigate the implementation of `getNativeType` and `isSubtype` methods to confirm they handle all types involved in the test (`OBJECT_NUMBER_STRING_BOOLEAN` and `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`) correctly, particularly how these types interact or are determined to be subtypes in the context of JavaScript functions.
