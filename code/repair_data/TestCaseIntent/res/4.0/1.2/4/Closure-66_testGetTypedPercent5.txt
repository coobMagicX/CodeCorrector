Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testGetTypedPercent5` is to verify that the percentage of typed JavaScript code is correctly calculated as 100% for an enum declaration where all keys are explicitly typed as numbers.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should involve ensuring that the type inference and accounting for the `OBJECTLIT` case in the `visit` method correctly handles the enum type declaration and propagates the specified type (`number` in this case) to all the keys of the enum. This would likely involve checking the type propagation logic in cases like `Token.OBJECTLIT` and ensuring that when handling enum types, the type information is not lost or incorrectly computed. Additionally, the overall calculation of the percentage of typed code (`doPercentTypedAccounting` method) needs to be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the types established through the `visit` method calls.
