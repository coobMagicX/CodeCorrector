Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue631` is to verify that the `RegulaFalsiSolver` correctly finds the root of the function \( f(x) = e^x - \pi^3 \) within the interval [1, 10]. The test expects the solver to find the root accurately within a tolerance of \( 1e-15 \).

Repair strategy: To address the failure, the following steps should be considered:
1. Review the implementation of the `RegulaFalsiSolver` in the method `doSolve()`, focusing on how the interval [x0, x1] is updated and how the method deals with conditions when \( f1 \times fx \) does not change sign (which might indicate the need for a different strategy to update the interval or modify f0).
2. Ensure that the root refinement process in `doSolve()` respects the precision and convergence criteria specified, particularly in scenarios where the function changes behavior or the numerical methods might suffer from lack of progression due to the characteristics of the function.
3. Consider implementing additional logging within the `doSolve()` method to trace how the values of x0, x1, f0, and f1 evolve during the execution, which can help identify if there are issues with the convergence logic or interval swapping.
4. Test edge cases and boundary conditions, especially near the expected root, to ensure that they handle scenarios where the function approaches zero closely but does not sign-change, which is critical for methods like Regula Falsi.
5. Verify the handling of floating-point arithmetic issues, such as subtraction and division operations that might lead to significant rounding errors impacting the solver's accuracy and stability.
