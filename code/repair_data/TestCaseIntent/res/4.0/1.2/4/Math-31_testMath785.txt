Intent: The purpose of the test case `testMath785` is to evaluate the inverse cumulative probability function of the F-distribution for large degrees of freedom parameters, ensuring that the result is accurate and less than 1.0. This is critical for statistical applications, particularly in hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.

Repair strategy: The failure in calculating the inverse cumulative probability suggests potential issues with numerical stability or convergence in the `evaluate` method, which is used for computing continued fractions in the `FDistribution` class. The repair should focus on:

1. Enhancing the numerical stability in the `evaluate` method, especially when handling large parameters, to prevent overflow or underflow. This could involve refining the scaling logic to better manage the magnitudes of intermediate results.
2. Improving the convergence criteria or mechanism within the `evaluate` method. This could mean adjusting the criteria for breaking out of the loop or modifying the formula used for computing successive terms in the continued fraction.
3. Ensuring that the epsilon value and the maximum number of iterations (`maxIterations`) are appropriately set to allow the method to converge effectively for large parameter values typical of an F-distribution with large degrees of freedom. Adjusting these parameters might help the method to yield more accurate and stable results under extreme conditions.
4. Adding error handling or fallback mechanisms that can provide more informative errors or alternative computations when convergence issues are detected, rather than allowing the method to fail silently or produce incorrect results.
