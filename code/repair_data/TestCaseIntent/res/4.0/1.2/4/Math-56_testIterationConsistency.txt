Intent: The intent of the test case `testIterationConsistency` is to verify the correct iteration through a multidimensional counter structure. The test checks if all indices within the bounds of the structure are iterated correctly, maintaining proper mapping between unidimensional and multidimensional indices, and ensuring the size and indices are correctly returned without overstepping the structure's bounds.

Repair strategy: To repair the source code based on the failure observed in the test case, focus on the logic in `getCounts` method, particularly:
1. Verify the logic and calculations involving `offset` and `count` within the loops. It seems there might be errors in how indices are calculated or how the counts are incremented or decremented.
2. Ensure that indices are correctly computed to reflect each dimension of the structure accurately without any off-by-one errors.
3. Double-check the conditions in while-loops and for-loops to make sure they stop at the correct conditions, thus preventing any index out-of-bound errors.
4. Validate that the final computed indices array correctly represents the position in the multidimensional structure for each corresponding unidimensional index.
