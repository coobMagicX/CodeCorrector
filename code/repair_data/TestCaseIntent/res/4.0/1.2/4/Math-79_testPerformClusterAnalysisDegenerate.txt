Intent: The intent of the `testPerformClusterAnalysisDegenerate` test case is to validate the functionality of clustering a set of points using the `KMeansPlusPlusClusterer` class. The test aims to ensure that when clustering a small dataset (in this case, two points) into a single cluster, the algorithm correctly forms one cluster containing all the given points.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests a potential issue in how the `distance` method handles integer overflow. Given that the points have large integer coordinates, the calculation of the sum of squared differences (`dp * dp`) can exceed the maximum value storable in an `int` variable, leading to integer overflow. This issue can affect the clustering algorithm's behavior, as distance calculations are critical for forming clusters. The repair should involve modifying the `distance` method to handle large values safely, possibly by using `long` instead of `int` for the `sum` variable and the intermediate squared differences. This change will prevent overflow and ensure accurate distance calculations.
