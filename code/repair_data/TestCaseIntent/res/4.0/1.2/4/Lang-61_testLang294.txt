Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLang294` is to evaluate the functionality of the `deleteAll` method in the `StrBuilder` class. This method is supposed to remove all occurrences of the specified substring (`"\n%BLAH%"`) from the `StrBuilder` object's content.

Repair strategy: Given the failure at the line `sb.deleteAll("\n%BLAH%");`, it suggests that the `deleteAll` method, which likely relies on the `indexOf` method to find the substring, is not functioning as expected. The potential error in the `indexOf` method could be related to handling multi-character substrings across different lines or with special characters. The repair should involve ensuring that the `indexOf` method correctly handles substrings that include newline characters and other non-alphanumeric characters. Additionally, confirm that the loop bounds and conditions in `indexOf` method correctly cover all valid indices and scenarios, particularly checking if it accurately scans the entire buffer until the last possible start index for the target substring.
