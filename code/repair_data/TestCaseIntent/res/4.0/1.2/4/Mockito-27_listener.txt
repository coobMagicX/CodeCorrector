Intent: The purpose of the test case `listener` is to validate that `resetMock` method properly resets a mocked object while retaining its configured invocation listeners. The test aims to ensure that after resetting, the mock should still trigger the configured listeners upon method invocation (in this case, `mockedList.clear()`).

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to ensure that the reset operation on the mock object preserves or reconfigures the invocation listeners that were initially set on the mock object. This might involve modifying the `resetMock` method to copy the existing settings (specifically invocation listeners) from the old mock handler to the new mock handler or ensuring that any other relevant configuration is not lost during the reset process. This will ensure that the invocation listeners still receive notifications post-reset when methods on the mock object are called.
