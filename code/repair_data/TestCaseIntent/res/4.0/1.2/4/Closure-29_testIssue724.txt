Intent: The test case `testIssue724` intends to verify the behavior of the `isInlinableObject` method in scenarios involving function checks and handling of JavaScript objects and properties. The purpose is to ensure that the method can handle and optimize JavaScript code correctly under advanced compilation options.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to better support the handling of JavaScript functions and the use of `this` in method calls. Specifically, the algorithm needs to be adapted to ensure that cases like `getType.toString.apply(functionToCheck)` are properly recognized as valid and potentially inlinable, rather than incorrectly treated due to misinterpretation of object properties or method calls. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure it correctly interprets and handles ES5 getters and setters, which are currently unsupported according to the commented notes. Revising the handling of object properties and improving the detection of valid inlining scenarios would be crucial. This includes adapting the `isInlinableObject` method to better recognize and process object literals and method calls within JavaScript code provided as input.
