Intent: The test case `testLocalizedSideEffects8` is designed to verify that the function correctly identifies and handles objects created by constructors (`new A`) which are subsequently modified (e.g., `a.foo = 1`) but still treated as local due to these modifications not being global side effects.

Repair strategy: Review and potentially modify the handling of the `Token.NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function. The current implementation always returns `true`, which might be too simplistic. This needs to be adjusted to check whether the object created by the constructor is modified locally and that these modifications do not cause any global side effects. The approach could involve enhancing the logic to track modifications post object creation and confirm they are confined to the local scope.
