Intent: The test case "shouldEvaluateLatestStubbingFirst" is intended to verify that the mock object's behavior prioritizes the most recent stubbing configuration. It checks whether the method returns the correct value based on the latest stubbing for different inputs.

Repair strategy: The failure suggests an issue in handling argument types or matching arguments correctly in the stubbing mechanism. The repair should focus on ensuring that the mock framework correctly recognizes and matches the argument types and values specified in different stubbing scenarios. This could involve enhancing the logic that compares or matches method arguments in the stubbing process, potentially by refining how argument matchers handle equality or type checks. Additionally, verify and if necessary correct the logic in the captureArgumentsFrom method to ensure it correctly captures and processes arguments for stubbing and matching, especially considering type conversions and comparisons.
