Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue794b` is to evaluate whether the method `hasExceptionHandler` can correctly identify and handle the presence of exception handling constructs (try-catch blocks) within a given code fragment. Specifically, the test checks if the method recognizes and processes the exception handling correctly to ensure proper updates and functionality in scenarios involving exceptions.

Repair strategy: The source code method `hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode)` currently always returns `false`, indicating it does not detect any exception handlers regardless of the input. To pass the test case, modify the `hasExceptionHandler` method to correctly analyze the provided node (or code fragment) to check for the presence of try-catch blocks or similar exception handling mechanisms. This may involve parsing the node to look for specific patterns or structures that represent exception handling in the code, and then returning `true` if such structures are found, otherwise `false`. This repair should ensure that the method dynamically responds based on the actual content of the node, rather than just returning a static response.
