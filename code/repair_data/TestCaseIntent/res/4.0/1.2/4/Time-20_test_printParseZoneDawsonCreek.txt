Intent: The test case `test_printParseZoneDawsonCreek` aims to validate the functionality of parsing and formatting date-time strings with a specific time zone ("America/Dawson_Creek") using the `DateTimeFormatter`. The test checks if the formatter correctly interprets and returns a `DateTime` object that matches an explicitly created `DateTime` object with the same time zone.

Repair strategy: The issue appears to be with the parsing function `parseInto` which may incorrectly match with a shorter time zone ID if it appears before the intended longer ID in the `ALL_IDS` list (e.g., "America/Dawson" may be matched instead of "America/Dawson_Creek" if it comes first in the list). The strategy should involve modifying the parsing logic in `parseInto` to ensure that it correctly identifies and prioritizes the longest matching time zone ID from the position given in the input string. This could be achieved by checking all potential matches and selecting the longest one before setting the time zone in the `DateTimeParserBucket` object.
