Intent: The test case `can_mock_inner_classes()` is intended to verify that the method `createMock` can correctly mock inner classes using their constructors and can interact with an instance of the outer class. It specifically tests that the mocked inner class returns an expected string value from a method call.

Repair strategy: Examine the handling of inner classes within the `createMock` method, especially focusing on how instances of inner classes are created and how they interact with their outer class instances. Ensure the instantiation process supports inner class peculiarities, including the need to pass an instance of the outer class to the constructor of the inner class. This might involve adjusting how the `classInstantiator.instantiate(mockedProxyType)` manages inner class scenarios or ensuring that the outer instance is correctly used when instantiating inner classes.
