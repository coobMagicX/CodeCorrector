Intent: The intent of the test case `testAliasing7` is to ensure that when properties are assigned to a function's prototype using both dot notation and bracket notation, the assignments do not affect the integrity or the referencing of the values, specifically ensuring that aliases are preserved correctly.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the `isPrototypePropertyAssign` method to correctly identify and handle assignments to a function's prototype that use bracket notation. The current implementation seems to only effectively check for dot notation (`GETPROP`), and it may not correctly interpret or handle the bracket notation (`GETELEM`). To address the test case failure, the code should be adjusted to:
1. Include logic that checks for `GETELEM` as a node type in addition to `GETPROP`.
2. Ensure that the method accurately processes string literals within brackets that refer to 'prototype' as well as method assignments and aliasing through different notations.
3. Verify and ensure that both dot and bracket notations are treated equivalently in terms of logic handling within the codebase, without causing any discrepancies in behavior or state.
