Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to check that non-alias local variables, including simple assignments, compound assignments using library calls, and function declarations within a scoped environment, correctly trigger an error message indicating they are non-alias locals.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly identify and handle different types of variable declarations and assignments as non-alias locals. This includes:
1. Ensuring that all local variable declarations that do not meet the criteria for aliasing, such as function declarations or simple numeric assignments, are properly recognized and reported as errors.
2. Adjusting the condition checks in the `findAliases` method to appropriately catch and handle these cases, perhaps refining the condition that checks if a node's first child is a qualified name to also consider other types of assignments and declarations that should be treated as errors.
3. Enhancing the logic that determines whether a variable is an alias or a non-alias local, ensuring that different scenarios (like function declarations or basic assignments) are covered. This might involve adding more comprehensive checks before reporting a variable as non-alias local.
