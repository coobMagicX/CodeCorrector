Intent: The test cases aim to verify the layout behavior of a `BlockContainer` when arranged with various configurations of blocks placed at different positions (top, bottom, left, right, center) under fixed width constraints and unconstrained heights. The intent is to validate that the `BlockContainer` correctly calculates and respects the fixed width while dynamically adjusting the height based on the blocks' arrangements.

Repair strategy:
1. **Review and Adjust Block Arrangement Logic:** The `arrangeFF` method should be examined to ensure that it correctly computes the sizes and positions of blocks considering their sequential dependencies (e.g., top affects bottom, left affects right). This includes validating the calculations for setting heights and widths within the constraints provided, particularly ensuring that height adjustments are dynamically calculated after width adjustments to handle cumulative vertical block sizes correctly.
2. **Rectify Calculation Errors for Cumulative Heights:** Modify the handling of height calculations, especially in scenarios where multiple blocks are stacked vertically (e.g., top, center, bottom). Ensure cumulative heights are added correctly and the total height does not exceed the maximum height when specified by constraints.
3. **Ensure Constraint Propagation:** Ensure that when a block is arranged, the remaining space for subsequent blocks is correctly updated in the constraints passed to them. This is particularly crucial for the dynamic height adjustments in the presence of fixed width constraints.
4. **Boundary Condition Handling:** Add checks or logic adjustments to handle edge cases, such as when blocks have minimum sizes that exceed the available space or when no blocks are present.
5. **Debugging and Iterative Testing:** Use detailed logging or debugging to trace the values of widths and heights calculated during the arrangement process, and iteratively test with complex configurations to ensure all cases are handled correctly.

By following this strategy, the `BlockContainer`'s arrangement method should be able to pass all the specified test cases by correctly managing block layouts under various constraints and configurations.
