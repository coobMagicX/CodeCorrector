Intent: The intent of the test case `testMath718` is to evaluate the accuracy and numerical stability of the `evaluate` method within the `ContinuedFraction` implementation, particularly for large numbers of trials. The test aims to verify if the method consistently calculates the median (or near-median) of a binomial distribution as the number of trials increases massively.

Repair strategy: The failure appears when `int p = dist.inverseCumulativeProbability(0.5);` is executed, which suggests potential issues in the implementation of `inverseCumulativeProbability` or the `evaluate` method it relies on. To repair:
1. Review and adjust the numerical stability in the `evaluate` method, particularly ensuring that calculations involving large numbers or small increments do not lead to overflow, underflow, or loss of precision.
2. Check the scaling factors and their adjustments within the loop where `cN` and `q2` are calculated, as improper scaling might lead to infinite or NaN values that compromise the accuracy.
3. Ensure that the `epsilon` and `maxIterations` parameters are adequately set to handle large numbers without hitting the maximum iteration count prematurely or failing to converge due to too coarse epsilon.
4. Verify the implementation of `getA` and `getB` functions used in the `evaluate` method to ensure they handle large inputs correctly and do not introduce errors.
5. Consider implementing additional checks or alternative algorithms for cases where the current method fails to converge or provides unstable results for large trial numbers in the binomial distribution calculations.
