Intent: The intent of test case `testIssue787` is to ensure that the `traverse` function properly handles the transformations of JavaScript functions and their respective closures and references under the SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS compilation level. The test verifies that the function names and expressions are properly minified and that the external references within closures are maintained correctly.

Repair strategy: Examine and modify the `traverse` function to ensure it correctly identifies and handles function declarations, closures, and references during the tree traversal and optimization processes. The source code might be failing to handle specific patterns of function declarations and references, or not managing the scopes of variables correctly after transformations. The strategy should include enhancing the traversal logic to better recognize and optimize JavaScript patterns involving closures and external references. Additionally, verify and adjust the conditions under which `shouldRetraverse(node)` returns true, ensuring that it does not miss necessary re-traversals that affect the minification integrity.
