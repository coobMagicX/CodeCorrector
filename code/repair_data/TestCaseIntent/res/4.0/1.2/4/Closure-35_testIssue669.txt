Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue669` seems to be to verify that the `inferPropertyTypesToMatchConstraint` method correctly handles a function which conditionally initializes and returns objects with different properties based on input. The test checks if the method can handle cases where the returned object's property type is potentially undefined or mixed within different execution paths.

Repair strategy: Based on the failing test and the provided source code, the repair should focus on:
1. Enhancing the `inferPropertyTypesToMatchConstraint` method to better handle properties that are conditionally added to objects in different branches of a function. This includes managing properties that might not be present in all return paths.
2. Ensuring that properties which are undefined or not declared in all paths are correctly inferred and do not cause type mismatches or errors.
3. Adding logic to deal with merging or accommodating types from different conditional branches to ensure that the inferred types reflect all possible structures the object might have at runtime. This could include improvements in how properties are checked for being declared and their types inferred when not present.
