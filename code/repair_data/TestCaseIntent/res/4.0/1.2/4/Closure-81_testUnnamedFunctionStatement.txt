Intent: The test case `testUnnamedFunctionStatement` is intended to verify that the parser correctly handles unnamed function statements, ensuring that such functions are parsed without errors while also correctly handling named function statements and expressions.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the function parsing logic in the source code to ensure that unnamed function statements are handled correctly. This involves checking how the `functionNode` object (specifically when it lacks a name) is processed and ensuring the generated nodes correctly reflect the structure and syntax of an unnamed function in JavaScript. Ensure that the handling of line numbers and character positions does not introduce syntax or parsing errors. The error handling logic might also need adjustments to correctly interpret and report issues with unnamed functions.
