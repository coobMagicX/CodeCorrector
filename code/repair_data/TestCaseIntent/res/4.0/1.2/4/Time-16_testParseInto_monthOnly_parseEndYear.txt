Intent: The intent of the test case `testParseInto_monthOnly_parseEndYear` is to verify that the method `parseInto` correctly parses a single month input ("12") and updates the month of a given `MutableDateTime` object while keeping the other parts of the date-time (year, day, time, and zone) unchanged.

Repair strategy: The failure suggests an issue in how the parsed month is set in the `MutableDateTime` object. The repair should focus on ensuring that when a new month is parsed, it correctly updates the month field without altering other components of the date-time object, particularly when only the month field is provided in the input string. Adjustments might be needed in how the `DateTimeParserBucket` applies parsed fields to the existing `ReadWritableInstant` (in this case, `MutableDateTime`), especially ensuring the day of the month is correctly determined when the month changes (e.g., handling edge cases like end-of-month days).
