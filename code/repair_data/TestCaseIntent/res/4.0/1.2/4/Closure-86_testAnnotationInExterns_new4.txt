Intent: The test case `testAnnotationInExterns_new4` intends to verify that the expression `new externObjSEThis().externObjSEThisMethod('')` is considered side-effect free in its context. The method `checkMarkedCalls` is used to ensure that calls in the given string are marked correctly based on whether they are side-effect free or not.

Repair strategy: The `evaluatesToLocalValue` function should handle the `Token.NEW` case more accurately to check if the value created by the `new` operator is never aliased outside the constructor, which is similar to handling a local result in a function call. The current implementation of the `Token.NEW` case in `evaluatesToLocalValue` just returns true, which might not correctly represent the side-effect status of new object instances depending on how they are used post-construction. Adjust the handling of `Token.NEW` to incorporate a check for aliasing of the newly created object, potentially by enhancing the `callHasLocalResult` method or a similar approach to verify that the object's properties or state aren't modified externally after construction.
