Intent: The test case `testObject12()` aims to verify whether the function `isInlinableObject()` can correctly handle and process a variable declaration and assignment where the variable `a` is assigned an object literal `{x:1, y:2}`. It also checks the behavior when accessing properties of `a` in a function call, specifically testing its ability to maintain correct references and possibly optimize inline expansions.

Repair strategy: Review the `isInlinableObject()` function to ensure that it correctly identifies and processes object literals and property accesses as intended. Specifically, investigate how the function handles property accesses from an object (like `a.x` and `a.y2` in the test). Ensure that the function can accurately determine whether such references can be inlined or optimized, especially focusing on the condition checks for object properties and whether it correctly handles cases where properties might not be directly defined on the object (e.g., through prototypes or as undefined properties). Adjust the logic to correctly handle and validate object literals and property accesses, ensuring no incorrect short-circuiting or faulty assumptions about object structure and property definitions.
