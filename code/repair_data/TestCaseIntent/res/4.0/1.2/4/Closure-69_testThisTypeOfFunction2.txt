Intent: The test case `testThisTypeOfFunction2` aims to verify that the function `f()` which explicitly specifies a `this` type (indicating it should be invoked on an instance of `F`) throws an appropriate error when called without a corresponding `this` context. The purpose is to ensure that functions with a specific `this` type are not called standalone but are instead called with an appropriate object context.

Repair strategy: The source code should be extended to include a check that functions annotated with a specific `this` type must be invoked with a `this` context matching the specified type (e.g., through a property access syntax like `obj.f()` where `obj` is an instance of `F`). This can be implemented by analyzing the context in which the function is called within the `visitCall` method. If the function has a specified `this` type and is called without a property access (`GETPROP` or `GETELEM`), then an error should be reported. This requires modifying the condition or adding a new condition to handle this case effectively.
