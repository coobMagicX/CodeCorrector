Intent: The test case `testCheckGlobalThisOff` is intended to verify that the compiler does not emit warnings or errors for global `this` usages when the `globalThis` warning is explicitly turned off via command line arguments.

Repair strategy: Inspect and modify the handling of `options.checkGlobalThisLevel` within the `initOptions` method. Ensure that when `globalThis` is set to off (disabled), the corresponding warning level is correctly set to `CheckLevel.OFF` in the conditionals that adjust warning levels based on the `options.checkGlobalThisLevel` property. This involves ensuring that the `options.checkGlobalThisLevel` is accurately parsed from the command line arguments and correctly applied in setting the warning levels.
