Intent: The test case `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge` is designed to verify that the optimizer can handle scenarios where the difference between the upper and lower bounds is very large, close to causing an overflow. The purpose is to ensure that the optimizer does not produce errors or incorrect behaviors (like returning NaN values) when handling very large range differences between bounds.

Repair strategy: Modify the `checkParameters` method to include a check that ensures the difference between the upper and lower bounds does not exceed a safe threshold that could lead to overflow when used in calculations (specifically in normalization or encoding processes within the optimizer). If the difference is too large, the method should throw an appropriate exception to prevent further erroneous calculations. This can prevent the system from reaching a state where NaN or infinity might corrupt the optimization results. Additionally, handling for extreme values should be implemented to ensure that calculations remain within the bounds of double precision arithmetic without causing overflow or underflow.
