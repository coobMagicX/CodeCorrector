Intent: The test case `testThisTypeOfFunction3` is intended to verify that functions with explicit 'this' types are correctly handled when being called. Specifically, it checks that a method `bar` defined on the prototype of a constructor function `F` should maintain its 'this' type when called as a method of an instance of `F`.

Repair strategy: Investigate and modify the source code to ensure that methods or functions that have explicit 'this' types are being checked for their calling context to validate that they are called in a proper manner (e.g., not merely as detached functions but as methods bound to their respective instances). This might involve adding or refining checks in the `visitCall` method to handle cases where the function is retrieved from a property (like `GETPROP` or `GETELEM`) and ensuring that the 'this' type is correctly bound to the function during the call.
