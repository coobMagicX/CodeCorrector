Intent: The intent of the failing test case `shouldStubStringVarargs` is to validate the behavior of the `mock` object when it interacts with methods that take variable arguments (varargs). It tests both the return values of such methods and the exceptions they might throw under different input conditions. The test specifically looks to ensure that the method `withStringVarargsReturningString` when called with different numbers of arguments, correctly returns specified values or handles exceptions as expected.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the handling of varargs in the source code, specifically focusing on how the varargs are captured and processed. The current implementation might not be correctly handling the capture and passing of variable arguments to the matchers, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior when methods with variable arguments are invoked. Ensure that the method capturing logic differentiates between regular arguments and varargs properly and processes them correctly. This could involve adjusting how indices are calculated and how matchers are checked and invoked within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. Moreover, verify and possibly refactor the logic inside the loop that processes each matcher and captures arguments from the invocation to ensure that varargs are being correctly handled according to their special nature in Java (i.e., as arrays).
