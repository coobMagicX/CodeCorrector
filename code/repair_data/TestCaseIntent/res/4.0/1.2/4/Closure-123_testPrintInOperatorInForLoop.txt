Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify the correct handling and formatting of the 'in' operator within various expressions in a for loop. This includes situations where the 'in' operator is used alone, combined with other operators, within ternary conditions, and as part of function arguments.

Repair strategy: Inspect the handling of the 'in' operator in the source code, specifically within the context of for loops and conditional expressions. Ensure that 'in' is formatted correctly with appropriate spacing and parenthesization to match the expected output in test cases. This might involve adjusting the logic that formats binary operations or expressions within the `addExpr` method or the specific case handling for `Token.IN` in a `for` loop scenario.
