Intent: The `testLocalValue` method aims to determine whether given JavaScript expressions evaluate to local values based on the structure and properties of the Node representing the expression. The failing test case specifically tests the expression `new x()`, which should resolve to a non-local value unless the constructor ensures no aliasing occurs.

Repair strategy: Modify the handling of the `Token.NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to include a check that determines whether the object created by the `new` operator is guaranteed to not be aliased. This might involve analyzing the constructor's behavior or additional context about object creation and usage provided by the `locals` predicate or similar mechanisms.
