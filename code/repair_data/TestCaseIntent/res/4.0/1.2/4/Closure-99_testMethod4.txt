Intent: The intent of the `testMethod4` is to check whether the method `shouldTraverse` correctly handles the traversal of function assignments to computed properties of a prototype, specifically using bracket notation (e.g., `a.prototype['x' + 'y']`). The test aims to verify if such assignments are correctly traversed or skipped depending on the method's logic for handling prototype properties.

Repair strategy: The error potentially arises from the method `shouldTraverse` not adequately handling bracket notation for accessing properties on prototypes. The current implementation only checks for dot notation (`GETPROP`) and the string "prototype" directly. To fix this issue, the source code should be updated to better handle different types of property access on prototypes, including both dot notation and bracket notation. This can be done by enhancing the condition checks to include scenarios where the property names are dynamically computed (as in the failed test case) and ensuring that such cases are treated similarly to static property names when deciding whether to traverse or skip the node.
