Intent: The function `isInlinableObject(List<Reference> refs)` is designed to determine whether a set of object references within JavaScript code can be inlined. This is likely part of a JavaScript optimization or transformation tool intended to improve performance or readability by replacing object references with direct variable assignments when certain conditions are met.

Repair strategy: The failed test case indicates a problem with handling scenarios where objects are reassigned in a loop, such as `a = {x:1, y:1};` inside a `while` loop. The source code should include logic to handle or appropriately flag object reassignments that occur within loop constructs. This could involve enhancing checks for the usage context of the object, specifically identifying and handling loop scenarios distinctively to prevent incorrect inlining that might disrupt the logical flow of the program. The repair might involve modifying the `isInlinableObject` method to trace the scope and lifecycle of the object references more accurately within loops. Additionally, consider improving the handling of object properties that are added conditionally or in different blocks of the code (e.g., inside conditional statements), ensuring that such dynamic modifications are accounted for in the decision to inline an object.
