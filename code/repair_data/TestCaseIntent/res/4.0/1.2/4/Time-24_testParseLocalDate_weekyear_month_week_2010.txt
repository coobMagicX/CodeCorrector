Intent: The test case `testParseLocalDate_weekyear_month_week_2010` is intended to verify that the method correctly parses a date string formatted with a week-based year (`xxxx`), month, and week number (`MM-ww`) and creates the correct `LocalDate` object for the first week of January 2010.

Repair strategy: The issue likely arises due to incorrect handling or interpretation of the week-based year format (`xxxx`) in the `computeMillis` method. The conversion appears to be incorrectly mapping the week and week-year to the day and month fields. To repair this:
1. Ensure that the `computeMillis` method properly interprets and converts week-based years and week numbers into the correct date.
2. Verify and possibly adjust the handling of the `DateTimeFieldType` used within the `saveField` method when week-based years and specific weeks are involved.
3. Check that the sorting and setting of the date fields correctly handle the transition from week-year to actual calendar dates.
4. Additional handling might be needed to correctly interpret the edge cases around the start and end of a year, especially when the week spans across two different years.
