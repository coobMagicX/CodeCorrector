Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testRemoveGlobal1` appears to be to verify that the function `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` correctly handles the removal of unused function arguments. Specifically, it tests that when `removeGlobal` is set to `false`, the function does not remove unused function arguments even if they are not referenced within the function body.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve ensuring that the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method respects the `removeGlobal` flag before deciding to remove unreferenced arguments. This could involve adding a condition to check the state of `removeGlobal` within the method, and only proceed with removing unreferenced function arguments if `removeGlobal` is `true`. Additionally, ensure that the method handles cases where function arguments might still technically be unreferenced within the function body but shouldn't be removed due to the setting of `removeGlobal`. This will likely involve modifying the conditional logic around the removal of function arguments in the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method.
