Intent: The test case `testLang538` is intended to ensure that the formatting of a `Calendar` object, representing a specific date and time, is correctly converted into a string format according to the specified date-time pattern and timezone. The test specifically checks that the date-time string is formatted as UTC (GMT) despite the `Calendar` object being in a different time zone (GMT-8).

Repair strategy: The failure suggests that the `format` method in the `FastDateFormat` class may not be correctly handling the timezone conversion when formatting the date. The source code should be checked to ensure that:
1. The `Calendar` object's timezone is properly converted to the timezone specified in the `FastDateFormat` instance (in this case, GMT).
2. The formatting pattern ("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'") is applied correctly after the timezone conversion.
3. Ensure that any cloning or modification of the `Calendar` object inside the `format` method (or elsewhere affecting the `format` method) retains the correct time and timezone settings. 

This may involve debugging and potentially fixing how the timezone is set or overridden in the `format` method, or ensuring that the `Calendar` clone operation (if used) correctly copies all necessary fields.
