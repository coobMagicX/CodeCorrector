Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to ensure that the Mockito framework can handle the mocking of inner classes correctly, particularly when an incorrect outer instance type is provided. The test case aims to validate that a meaningful error is thrown, guiding the developer to check the instance type and constructor requirements.

Repair strategy: Enhance the error handling in the `createMock` function to include more specific checks and messages for situations involving inner classes. Specifically, add validation to check the compatibility of the outer instance type with the inner class being mocked. If the type is incorrect, a more descriptive and helpful error message should be provided, possibly suggesting the correct type or additional configuration needed.
