Intent: The purpose of the function `mayBeString` is to determine if a provided `Node` object may be a string. It does so by either recursively checking all results using the `MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE` or by using the `mayBeStringHelper` function, depending on the value of the `recurse` parameter.

The failed test cases are trying to test the string folding functionality where a string is combined with numeric values in a JavaScript line of code. The intent is to check if the function correctly identifies and processes such operations.

Fix strategy: The failure appears to be occurring because the function may not handle the ternary operator (?:) correctly, especially when combined with the addition operator (+). One possible solution is to enhance the `MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE` and `mayBeStringHelper` functions to handle ternary operations where one of the operands could be a string. Another approach is to check if any of the operands in an operation are strings, and if so, treat the entire operation as a string operation to prevent type inconsistency errors. The exact fix would depend on the implementation details of `MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE` and `mayBeStringHelper`.
