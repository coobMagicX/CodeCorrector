Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the range of data for a given axis in a scatter plot. It does this by checking if the axis is a domain or range axis, and then iterating through the datasets that map to the axis, finding the union of the ranges. It also includes annotations that contain XYAnnotationBoundsInfo in the data bounds calculation. 

The failing test case is intended to check the auto range functionality of the chart. It adds a series of points to a dataset, creates a scatter plot using this dataset, and then asserts that the lower and upper bounds of the range axis are as expected.

Fix strategy: The specific failure line indicates that the creation of the scatter plot is where the problem lies. However, it seems that the issue might be related to the range calculation in the getDataRange() method, which is used when the chart is being created. 

A possible issue could be that the auto range calculation does not correctly handle the case when axis.setAutoRangeIncludesZero(false) is set. The range calculated in this case might still be including zero, causing the test assertions to fail.

To fix this, ensure that when setAutoRangeIncludesZero(false) is set, the range calculation in getDataRange() does not include zero. This might involve adding a condition to check the status of AutoRangeIncludesZero and adjusting the range calculation logic accordingly.
