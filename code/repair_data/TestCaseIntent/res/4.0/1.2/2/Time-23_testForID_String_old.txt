Intent: The test case aims to verify the correctness of timezone ID conversions by comparing expected IDs from a predefined map against IDs obtained through Java's TimeZone and Joda-Time's DateTimeZone APIs. The intent is to ensure that both old and updated timezone IDs are correctly mapped and recognized across different timezone handling systems.

Repair strategy: To address the failure in this test case, the repair should focus on updating the getConvertedId method to include mappings that reflect both old and newer timezone standards. The current source code does not handle cases where timezone IDs have been updated or changed, such as 'CET' which is expected to map to 'Europe/Paris'. Adding these missing or updated mappings directly into the cZoneIdConversion map would likely resolve the failures observed. This would ensure that when the test queries for timezone IDs that have undergone changes, the source code provides the correct, expected output.
