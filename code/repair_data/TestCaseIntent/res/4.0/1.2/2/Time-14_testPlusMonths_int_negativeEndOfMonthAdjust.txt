Intent: The intent of this source code is to add a certain value to a specific field of a given date (represented as a ReadablePartial object). Specifically, it takes into account cases where adding to the month field might result in a date that does not exist (e.g., February 29 in a non-leap year), and it adjusts the date accordingly.

Fix strategy: The failing test case indicates that when subtracting months from a given date, the resultant date is not expected when the day of the month is higher than the maximum day of the resultant month. 

The problem appears to be in the 'add' method. It seems that it doesn't correctly handle the end of month adjustment for leap years. A possible fix would be to update the 'add' method to check if the resultant date is valid and if not, adjust the day to the maximum day of the resultant month. 

For example, if the original date is March 31 and we subtract one month, the result should be February 29 in a leap year or February 28 in a non-leap year. The 'add' method should take this into account. 

This change would need to be carefully tested to ensure it does not introduce regressions in other parts of the code.
