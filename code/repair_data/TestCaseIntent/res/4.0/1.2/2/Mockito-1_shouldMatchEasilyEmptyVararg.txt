Intent: The purpose of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation by iterating through the list of matchers. If the matcher is an instance of CapturesArguments, then capture the argument from the invocation. If the matcher is a vararg matcher, it captures all the arguments from the vararg array.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be with the handling of varargs in the source code. The UnsupportedOperationException is thrown when the method has varargs, which is not handled properly in the test case. A fix strategy could involve adding a check to see if the method has varargs and if so, handle the varargs properly. Instead of throwing an UnsupportedOperationException, we could add logic to handle varargs. 

Also, the test case is failing because it's trying to match with an empty vararg, but our logic does not correctly handle this scenario. We should add a condition to check if the vararg array is empty and, if so, return the default value. 

The code fix could look something like this:

```
if (invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs() && invocation.getRawArguments().length > 0) { 
    // add logic to handle varargs 
} else if (invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs() && invocation.getRawArguments().length == 0) {
    return; // or return a default value
}
```

In the test case, we should also consider adding a case to handle non-empty varargs to ensure our new logic works as expected.
