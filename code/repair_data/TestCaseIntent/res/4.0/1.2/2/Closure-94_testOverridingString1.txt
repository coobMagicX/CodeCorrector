Intent: This source code is a part of a static code analyzer or a compiler used for validating the value assigned to a define variable. The function `isValidDefineValue` checks if the value assigned to a define variable is a valid type (string, number, boolean) or a valid binary/unary operation or a valid name that is defined elsewhere. 

The failed test case `testOverridingString1` is checking if the function correctly handles string concatenation as value of a define variable. The function is expected to return true when the value assigned to a define variable is a result of a string concatenation.

Fix strategy: The function does not handle the case where the value assigned to a define variable is a result of a string concatenation operation. This can be fixed by adding an additional case in the switch statement to handle `Token.ADD` operation. In this case, the function should check if both operands of the addition operation are valid strings.
