Intent: The source code's purpose is to calculate the initial domain of an F-distribution given a certain probability. The F-distribution is a type of statistical distribution that is often used in analysis of variance (ANOVA). The failed test cases are trying to verify the correct implementation of the inverse cumulative probability function for different degrees of freedom.

Fix strategy: The issue lies in the calculation of the initial domain in the getInitialDomain() function. When the denominator degrees of freedom (d) is 2, the calculation d / (d - 2.0) results in a division by zero error. A fix strategy would be to handle this specific case and ensure that division by zero does not occur. This could be done by adding a conditional statement to check if 'd' equals 2.0 and then setting 'ret' to a default value or throwing an error. This specific fix would depend on the mathematical context and what is most appropriate for the case where denominator degrees of freedom is 2.
