Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points, represented as arrays. The purpose of the failed test case is to test the functionality of a clustering algorithm (KMeansPlusPlusClusterer) that groups points into clusters based on their distances. 

Fix strategy: The failure in the test case occurs at the line where the clustering algorithm is applied. The issue could be due to the points not being properly clustered. To fix this issue, ensure that the parameters passed to the 'cluster' method are correct. Check that the dimensions of the points are correctly defined and that the number of clusters requested (1 in this case) is not more than the number of unique points. If the problem persists, there might be a problem with the clustering algorithm implementation itself, and that will need to be debugged and fixed.
