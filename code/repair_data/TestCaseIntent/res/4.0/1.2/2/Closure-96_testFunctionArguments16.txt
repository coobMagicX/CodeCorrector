Intent: The intent of the source code is to validate the arguments passed to a function during a call. It checks if the number of arguments and their types match those defined in the function's signature. If not, it reports an error.

Fix strategy: The error appears when a boolean value is passed as a second argument to a function that expects a number. The problem appears to be in the test case, not in the code itself. The function `g` is defined to take any number of arguments, but all of them must be numbers. However, the test case is calling the function with a boolean value as a second argument. Therefore, the test case should be corrected to pass only numbers. The corrected test case would look like this:

```
public void testFunctionArguments16() throws Exception {
    testTypes(
        "/** @param {...number} var_args */" +
        "function g(var_args) {} g(1, 2);",
        "actual parameter 2 of g does not match formal parameter\n" +
        "found   : number\n" +
        "required: (number|undefined)");
}
```
