Intent: The initial intent of the source code is to add a number to a string while taking into account the special case of negative zeros and formatting the number accordingly.

Fix strategy: The test case fails because the expected output is "x- -0.0" while the function gives "x- -0". The function fails to handle the case of negative zero correctly and does not add the decimal point. The fix strategy would be to explicitly handle the case of negative zero and format it as "-0.0". This could be done by modifying the condition in the "if" statement and adding an "else if" condition to handle negative zero. Here is a suggested fix:

```java
  if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero) {
    // existing code
  } else if (negativeZero) {
    add("-0.0");
  } else {
    add(String.valueOf(x));
  }
```
With this change, the function should correctly handle negative zero and the failed test case should pass.
