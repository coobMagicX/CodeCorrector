Intent: The test case testDateTimeCreation_london aims to ensure that the DateTime object correctly represents the local time in London during a daylight saving time transition. Specifically, it verifies the behavior during the end of DST, expecting the DateTime to properly adjust to the correct offset.

Fix strategy: The issue lies in the handling of offsets exactly equal to zero, which is critical during DST transitions where the offset changes from a positive value to zero. The existing code fails to handle the case when the offset is zero by only considering positive offsets in its condition. The correct repair would involve changing the condition from offsetLocal > 0 to offsetLocal >= 0. This modification ensures that the method includes cases where the offset is zero, addressing the proper handling of transitions at times when DST ends and the offset returns to zero. This change directly targets the failure observed in the test case and should resolve the issue by ensuring that times around the DST boundary are correctly adjusted to reflect the true local time.
