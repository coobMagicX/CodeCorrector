Intent: The purpose of the source code is to add a new `XYDataItem` to the data series or update an existing one if it exists. It ensures that duplicate X values are not allowed. If a duplicate X value is found, it updates the Y value of the existing item. If the item count exceeds the maximum item count after adding a new item, it removes the first item. The function also handles if the data series should be sorted or not.

Fix strategy: The problem lies in the handling of duplicate X values. The code currently overwrites the Y value of the existing item but does not add a new item, which is why the test case fails since it expects two items in the series. To fix the issue, we need to modify the behavior of the function so that, when it encounters a duplicate X value, it retains the existing item and also adds a new item. 

Here's the fix strategy:

1. Remove the condition that checks and prevents duplicate X values.
2. After updating the Y value of the existing item, also add a new item to the series with the duplicate X value and the new Y value.
3. Ensure the update doesn't exceed the maximum item count by adjusting the removal condition.
