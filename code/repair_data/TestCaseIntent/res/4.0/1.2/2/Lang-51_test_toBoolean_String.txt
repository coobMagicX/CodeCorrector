Intent: The purpose of this code is to convert a String object into boolean. It returns 'true' if the string is "true", "on", "yes" in any case (lowercase, uppercase, mixed), and 'false' for any other string. If the string is null, it also returns 'false'. 

Fix strategy: The failed test case is "tru", which is not fully evaluated due to the use of a switch statement that only evaluates strings of lengths 2, 3, and 4. We could add a default case to our switch block to handle strings of other lengths. For this specific case, "tru" should return 'false' as it is not exactly "true". However, if the intent of the code is to consider "tru" (and other similar abbreviations) as 'true', we should adjust the method to handle these cases. For now, I will consider "tru" as 'false' because it is not exactly "true". 

Additionally, the comparison of String objects using '==' operator in the conditions `if (str == "true")` and `if (str == null)` is not ideal. The '==' operator here checks if the both references points to the same object, not their values. Therefore, it's better to use `equals()` or `equalsIgnoreCase()` method for string comparisons.

Here is the fix:
```java
public static boolean toBoolean(String str) {
    if ("true".equalsIgnoreCase(str)) {
        return true;
    }
    if (str == null) {
        return false;
    }
    switch (str.length()) {
        case 2: {
            return str.equalsIgnoreCase("on");
        }
        case 3: {
            return str.equalsIgnoreCase("yes");
        }
        case 4: {
            return str.equalsIgnoreCase("true");
        }
        default: {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, `equalsIgnoreCase()` method is used to handle case differences and a default case is added to the switch block to handle strings of lengths other than 2, 3, and 4.
