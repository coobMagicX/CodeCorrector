Intent: The purpose of the source code is to check whether two given Calendar objects represent the same local time or not. It does this by comparing their individual parameters like milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, day of year, year, era, and class type. 

The failing test case is supposed to confirm if two different instances of Calendar objects (cal3 and cal4), set at different hours, correctly return false when checked with the isSameLocalTime method. 

Fix strategy: The source code seems to ignore timezone differences while comparing the two Calendar objects. In the failing test case, the Calendar instances cal3 and cal4 are created without specifying a timezone, thus defaulting to the system's current timezone. But the test case seems to expect the times to be treated as GMT, which is likely the cause of the test failure. 

To fix this, we need to take into account the timezone difference when comparing the two Calendar objects. The HOUR field of Calendar class returns the hour following the 12-hour clock convention. Instead, we should use the HOUR_OF_DAY field, which returns the hour of the day for the 24-hour clock. 

Additionally, the timezone should be considered when comparing Calendar objects. It could be achieved by converting both Calendar objects to a common timezone before comparing. 

Also, checking if the class type of cal1 and cal2 are identical might not be necessary because two Calendar objects can have the same local time even if they are instances of different Calendar subclasses.
