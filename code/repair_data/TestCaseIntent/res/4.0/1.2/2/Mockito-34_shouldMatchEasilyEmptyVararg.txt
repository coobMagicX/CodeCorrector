Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a specific invocation. This is done by iterating through a list of matchers, and for each matcher that is an instance of CapturesArguments, the arguments from the invocation are captured accordingly. The failing test case is intended to verify whether the function `foo()` would return `-1` when it is called without arguments, given that it was set up to return `-1` when called with any variable number of arguments.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be in the mock setup. The mock is set to return `-1` when the method `foo()` is called with any number of arguments (anyVararg()), but in the test assertion, `foo()` is called without any arguments. This discrepancy could be the reason for the test case failure. 

To fix this, you can either change the mock setup to expect `foo()` to be called with no arguments, or modify the test assertion to call `foo()` with a variable number of arguments. The correct fix will depend on the requirements of your code. If `foo()` is expected to handle calls with no arguments, then the mock setup should be changed. If `foo()` always expects arguments, then the test assertion should be updated.
