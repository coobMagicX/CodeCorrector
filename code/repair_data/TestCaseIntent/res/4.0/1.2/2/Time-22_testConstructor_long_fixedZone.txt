Intent: The intent of the test case testConstructor_long_fixedZone is to verify that the constructor Period(long duration) correctly initializes a period using a long value representing a duration, accounting for different time fields (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds). This is tested in a fixed time zone to ensure that time zone variations do not affect the duration calculations.

Fix strategy: The failure at assertEquals(0, test.getWeeks()); suggests that the Period constructor is improperly calculating the number of weeks when initializing from a duration value. The code might be including weeks in its calculation where it should not, possibly due to an error in handling the base period's construction or duration conversion methods. The repair should involve verifying and adjusting the period calculation logic within the constructor to ensure that weeks are set to zero when initializing from a duration, unless explicitly accounted for by the period type definition.
