Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the density of a Multivariate Normal Distribution given a set of values. The test case aims to validate the accuracy of this calculation by comparing it to the density of a Univariate Normal Distribution for a series of random values.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs at the assertion line where the density of the univariate distribution does not match the multivariate one within a certain tolerance. The problem could be due to the precision of the calculation or a discrepancy between the univariate and multivariate methods. 

1. Check the implementation of the `getExponentTerm(vals)` method and `FastMath.pow` functions. Make sure the calculation is done correctly and accurately.
2. Review the `getDimension()` method to ensure it returns the correct dimension.
3. Investigate the possibility that the Univariate and Multivariate distributions may not be equivalent as assumed. If this is the case, consider adjusting the test to compare the Multivariate distribution to a more appropriate benchmark.
4. If the discrepancy is due to the precision issue, consider increasing the tolerance (tol) in the test case.
