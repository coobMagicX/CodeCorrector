Intent: The source code's purpose is to handle object literal nodes in some form of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) during a traversal process. It checks for the properties of these objects, verifies if the properties need renaming and reports errors if any invalidation occurs.

The failed test case is trying to ensure that the properties of two different objects (Foo and Bar) with similar properties ('a') do not interfere with each other during the renaming process.

Fix strategy: The failure might be due to the object literals sharing the same property name 'a'. The error might be in the `getProperty(name)` method which may not be correctly distinguishing between properties from different objects.

To fix this, ensure that the `getProperty(name)` method uses both the object name and the property name to uniquely identify properties across different objects. This way, when the property 'a' of object 'Foo' is being processed, it doesn't conflict with property 'a' from object 'Bar'. The property name should be something like 'Foo.a' and 'Bar.a' instead of just 'a'.
