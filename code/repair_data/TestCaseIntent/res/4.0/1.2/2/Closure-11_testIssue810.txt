Intent: The purpose of the given source code is checking the validity of property access in JavaScript objects. It validates if a property or method is accessed from an object or dictionary, ensures the object isn't null or undefined, and verifies the property access to match with the object type. 

The failing test case "testIssue810" is trying to test the validation of an undeclared property 'unknownProp' being accessed in an object 'obj'.

Fix strategy: From the failed test case, it appears that the property 'unknownProp' is not defined for the object 'obj'. The fix strategy would be to ensure that the property 'unknownProp' is defined in the object 'obj' before it is accessed. The function 'testTypes' should properly handle this case and throw an error or warning when an undeclared property is accessed. Another strategy could be to add a condition in the source code to check whether the property exists in the object before accessing it.
