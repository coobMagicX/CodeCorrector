Intent: The intent of the source code is to compare the string descriptions of two objects - a Matcher 'm' and an Object 'arg'. The test case is intended to check the situation when the Object 'arg' is null.

Fix strategy: The issue here is that the Object 'arg' is null. Calling arg.toString() will result in a NullPointerException. The fix strategy would be to add null checking in the toStringEquals() method before calling the toString() method on the 'arg' object. The code could be modified as follows:

```
private boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {
    if (arg == null) {
        return StringDescription.toString(m) == null;
    } else {
        return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());
    }
}
```
This way, if 'arg' is null, the method will correctly return whether the string description of the Matcher 'm' is also null. If 'arg' is not null, it will continue to compare the string descriptions of 'm' and 'arg'.
