Intent: The purpose of the code is to implement a root-finding algorithm (Regula Falsi method). The algorithm is used to find the roots of a continuous single-variable function within a given range. The function is supposed to return the root of the function when it equals zero. The failed test case involves solving the equation `Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0)`, expecting the result to be `3.4341896575482003`.

Fix strategy: The failure might be due to the incorrect implementation of the root-finding algorithm or a problem with the handling of special cases. To fix this, the implementation needs to be reviewed and cross-checked with the algorithm it's supposed to implement. Ensure that it handles all edge cases correctly and that the method selection (ILLINOIS, PEGASUS) is working as expected. If the problem persists, the issue might be with the accuracy of the computation. In this case, consider increasing the precision or using a different method for calculating the root.
