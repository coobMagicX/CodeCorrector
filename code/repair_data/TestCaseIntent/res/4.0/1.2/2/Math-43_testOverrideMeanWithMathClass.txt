Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to add a value to a set of statistical measures. The values are added to the sum, square sum, minimum, maximum, logarithm sum, second moment, mean, variance, and geometric mean if they are not already instances of the respective classes. The 'n' counter is then incremented. The test case is intended to verify that the overridden mean is correctly computed when values are added. 

Fix strategy: The failure occurs when asserting that the evaluated mean of the scores is equal to the computed mean. This suggests that the 'meanImpl' is not being correctly updated when 'addValue' is called. One way to fix this issue could be to ensure that the 'meanImpl' is updated whenever a value is added. This can be done by moving the 'increment' method call for 'meanImpl' outside the 'if' condition checks so it's always incremented irrespective of its instance type.
