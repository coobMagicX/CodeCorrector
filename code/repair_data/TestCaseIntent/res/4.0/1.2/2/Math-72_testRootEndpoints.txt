Intent: The intent and purpose of the source code is to find a root of a given function within a certain interval. If the function's value at the initial guess or the endpoints is within a specified accuracy, function returns that value as the root. If not, it employs the Brent's method to find the root. The test cases are testing the functionality of this root-finding method, specifically when the root is at the endpoints.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be with the accuracy of the result. The function is supposed to return the root of the function within a specified accuracy, but the test cases are failing on the assertion that checks the accuracy of the result. The problem might be with the `functionValueAccuracy` variable. If it is not set properly, the function might return a value that is not within the needed accuracy. The fix could be to ensure the `functionValueAccuracy` is set to an appropriate value. If it's not the case, there might be an issue with the Brent's method implementation itself. Double-check the `solve` method that employs the Brent's method to ensure it's correctly implemented.
