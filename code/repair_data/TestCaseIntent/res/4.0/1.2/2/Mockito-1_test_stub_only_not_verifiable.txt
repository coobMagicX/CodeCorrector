Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation. If the method invoked has variable arguments (varargs), it throws an UnsupportedOperationException. However, if there are no variable arguments, it runs a loop to check if there are any matchers that implement 'CapturesArguments' interface, and captures the arguments from the invocation. The failing test case is trying to mock methods and verify if they were called with specific arguments. 

Fix Strategy: The line where the test case failed is trying to stub the method 'objectReturningMethod' to return '200' when called with '200'. The error might be due to the 'UnsupportedOperationException' thrown when the method has variable arguments. The code needs to be updated to handle variable arguments correctly. Instead of throwing an exception when encountering variable arguments, the code can be modified to iterate over the arguments and capture them just like it does for non-variable arguments. 

Moreover, if the method 'objectReturningMethod' is not designed to accept an Integer, the stubbing operation would fail. Ensure that the method is designed to accept an Integer as an argument.

Also, ensure that the 'localMock' is not a stub-only mock when trying to verify its interactions. In Mockito, interactions of a stub-only mock cannot be verified. If needed, the mock should be created without the 'stubOnly()' option.
