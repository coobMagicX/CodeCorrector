Intent: The purpose of this piece of code is to evaluate the value of a continued fraction. The specific part where the failure occurs is the test case written to evaluate the stability and accuracy of the `ContinuedFraction` implementation for large number of trials. 

Fix strategy: The failure is occurring at `int p = dist.inverseCumulativeProbability(0.5);` in the test case. Check the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `BinomialDistribution` class. Ensure this method is correctly implemented and is handling large inputs properly. 

Also, check the `evaluate` method in the source code for possible rounding or overflow issues with large input values. The `double` type variables could be subject to precision loss when dealing with large numbers or small fractions. Moreover, the infinite and NaN checks might not be sufficient to handle all edge cases. 

Finally, consider adding more specific test cases to the `evaluate` method that cover edge cases and large inputs. This will ensure that it can handle these cases correctly in the future.
