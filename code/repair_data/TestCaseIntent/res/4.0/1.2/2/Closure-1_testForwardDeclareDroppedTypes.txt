Intent: The intent of this source code is to remove any unreferenced function arguments within a given scope. The function takes a function scope as an argument and checks if there are any unreferenced function arguments. If there are, it removes them unless the function is a getter or setter. The function also checks if it can modify callers and if it can't, it continues to strip unreferenced arguments from the end of the function declaration.

Fix strategy: The failed test cases indicate issues with the handling of forward-declared types in the "removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs" function. The test case that failed is trying to declare a 'beer' type and a 'Scotch' type, but the function is not handling these types correctly. 

To fix the issue, you should improve the handling of forward-declared types in the function. This could involve adding a check for forward-declared types and handling them appropriately. Additionally, the error reporting should be improved to give more detailed information about the type of error that occurred, which would make it easier to debug issues in the future.
