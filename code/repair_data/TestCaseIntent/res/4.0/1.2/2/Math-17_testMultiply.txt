Intent: The purpose of the source code is to multiply a given number by another number. The function takes an integer input and multiplies it with another number. The failed test case is intended to test the multiplication of the number 1 and 10000.

Fix strategy: From the information provided, it isn't clear why the test case failed as the provided source code seems to be correct. In order to fix this issue, more information is needed such as the error message or the implementation of the "multiplyFast" and "test" method. However, a good starting point could be checking the values returned by the "multiplyFast" method and ensuring it works as expected for large input values. You should also confirm that the "test" method correctly compares the expected and actual results.
