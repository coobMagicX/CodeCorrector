Intent: The intent of the given source code is to determine if a particular function (fnNode) can be inlined within a specific function call (callNode) without modifying the behavior of the code. This is done by checking certain conditions such as checking if the function is directly called, the presence of 'this' object as the first parameter and any side effects within the function.

Fix Strategy: From the failed test cases, it appears that the code does not handle complex inline functions correctly. The issue could be due to the handling of arguments that are evaluated more than once. One possible fix could be to revise the condition where it checks for arguments that are evaluated more than once. Specifically, the condition `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState(cArg, compiler) && NodeUtil.getNameReferenceCount(block, fnParam.getString()) > 1` might need to be adjusted.
