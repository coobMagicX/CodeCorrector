Intent: This code is a part of a type checker for JavaScript code, specifically for the Google Closure Compiler. Its purpose is to traverse a JavaScript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and ensure that each node is properly typed based on the JavaScript syntax rules. The type information is used for static type checking and optimization. The failing test case is aimed to validate whether the type checker correctly assigns and recognizes types in a JavaScript object literal.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs in the test case where an object literal is assigned with properties 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'. It's possible that the type checker fails to correctly assign or recognize types for these properties. The type checker should be revised to handle this specific case correctly. In the 'case Token.OBJECTLIT' section of the switch statement, an additional check should be added to handle boolean literal keys.
