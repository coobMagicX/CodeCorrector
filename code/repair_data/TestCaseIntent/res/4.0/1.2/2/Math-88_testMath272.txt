Intent: The purpose of the source code is to solve a linear problem using the simplex method. The `getSolution()` function is responsible for finding the solution of the linear equation by calculating the coefficients of the decision variables. The failed test case `testMath272` is checking if the solver is correctly finding the minimum value of a linear objective function under certain constraints. 

Fix strategy: The failure occurs in the line `assertEquals(1.0, solution.getPoint()[2], .0000001)`, this means the value of the third coefficient is not being calculated correctly. The problem could be in the way the `getSolution()` function is calculating the coefficients, particularly for multiple variables. The fix could involve modifying the calculation logic for coefficients in `getSolution()` to correctly handle multiple variables.
