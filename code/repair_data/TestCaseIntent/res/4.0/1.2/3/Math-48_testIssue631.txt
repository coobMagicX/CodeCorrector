Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to implement a root finding algorithm known as the Regula Falsi method (also known as the method of false position). This algorithm is used to find the roots of a function in a given interval [x0, x1]. The function is evaluated at these points, and if the function's value at either of these points is zero, that value is returned as the root. If not, the algorithm iteratively refines the interval until it converges on the root of the function.

Fix strategy: The failed test case suggests that the root finding method is not returning the correct root value for the given function and interval. This could be due to various reasons such as inaccuracies in floating point calculations or issues in the algorithm's implementation. Here are some strategies to fix this:

1. Check the implementation of the Regula Falsi method to ensure it follows the correct mathematical procedure. 
2. The precision of the root (`1e-15` in this case) might be too high for the algorithm to reach. You might need to adjust the precision to a more reasonable value.
3. Ensure the 'computeObjectiveValue' method is correctly evaluating the function at the given points.
4. The 'getMin' and 'getMax' methods might not be returning the correct initial values for the interval. Make sure these methods are correctly implemented.
5. If the problem is due to floating point inaccuracies, consider using a library or method that provides higher precision arithmetic.
6. Make sure that the initial guesses x0 and x1 do indeed bracket the root.
