Intent: The intent of the source code is to remove unreferenced (unused) arguments from a function in a given scope. It uses certain conditions to determine whether to remove these arguments or not. For instance, it doesn't remove parameters of object literal setters and it also checks whether unreferenced arguments can be removed from the end of the function declaration.

Fix strategy: The failed test case "testSimpleModeLeavesUnusedParams" implies that the code fails to keep unused parameters when the compilation level is set to SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. The line testSame("window.f = function(a) {};"); is expected to remain the same after the function is executed, because the parameter 'a' is unused and the compilation level is SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. Therefore, a possible fix strategy would be to add an additional check for the compilation level before removing unused function arguments. If the compilation level is SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS, the code should not remove unreferenced function arguments.
