Intent: The purpose of the source code is to record assignments in a code block, especially within a FOR loop and assignment expressions that involve function calls. The code is designed to manage dependencies and to prevent incorrect reference edges between referenced and assigned variables.

Fix Strategy: The failure suggests that the code is not correctly handling assignments that involve function calls. It seems to fail when the assignment is the caller expression. The code comments also mention that it only fixes a specific case and there could be nested expressions resulting in bugs. An advisable fix strategy would be to enhance the handling of function calls within assignments, ensuring that deeply nested expressions are properly managed. Additionally, revisiting the dependency scope calculation logic as hinted by the TODO comment might help improve the code's functionality.
