Intent: The intent of the source code function isSimpleNumber is to determine if a string contains only numeric characters (0-9). If there are any non-numeric characters in the string, the function returns false. If the string is empty, it also returns false.

The failed test case is trying to use the function in a context where numbers can be represented in different formats such as octal (010), hexadecimal (0x10), and decimal (0.2). The specific failed line expects the function to treat the string '010' as a simple number. 

Fix strategy: The function isSimpleNumber needs to be modified or a new function needs to be written to handle different numeric representations. A regular expression can be used to check if a string matches any of the acceptable numeric formats. A possible fix strategy is as follows:

1. Modify the function to handle octal, hexadecimal, and decimal representations.
2. Use regular expressions to check for these formats.
3. If the string matches any of the formats, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Alternatively, a new function can be written to handle this specific requirement and leave the isSimpleNumber function as it is if it is needed for other parts of the code.
