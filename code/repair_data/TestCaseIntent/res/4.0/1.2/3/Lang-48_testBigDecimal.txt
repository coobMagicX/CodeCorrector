Intent: The intent of the provided source code is to compare two objects for equality. It handles various types of objects, including arrays of different data types. The comparison is based on the content and structure of the objects, not their references. In the failed test case, it's specifically testing the comparison of two BigDecimal numbers.

Fix strategy: The error seems to be caused by the fact that the 'append' method does not handle 'BigDecimal' objects correctly. Although the two BigDecimal objects, o1 and o2, are numerically equal, they are not equal in terms of their internal representation (precision matters for BigDecimal). The 'equals' method for BigDecimals checks not only the value but also the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), which is why it fails in this test case.

The fix strategy would be to add a specific condition in the 'append' method to handle 'BigDecimal' objects. When two 'BigDecimal' objects are encountered, they should be compared using the 'compareTo' method instead of 'equals'. This will ensure that two 'BigDecimal' objects are considered equal if they are numerically equal, regardless of their scale. 

Note: It's also critical to ensure that this special handling for 'BigDecimal' does not interfere with the general handling for arrays of objects.
