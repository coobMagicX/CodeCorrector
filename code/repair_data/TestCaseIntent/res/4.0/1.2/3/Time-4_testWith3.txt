Intent: The purpose of the source code is to create a new Partial object (a time representation) by adding or replacing a field (DateTimeFieldType) with a specified value. If the field already exists, its value will be replaced, otherwise the field will be added. The fields are kept in a sorted order from largest to smallest duration. If the value of the field is the same, the method returns the same Partial object.

Fix strategy: The failed test case indicates an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown when attempting to add a DateTimeFieldType.clockhourOfDay() to the Partial object, but it doesn't. This might be due to the fact that the method does not check if the field type is supported in the current Chronology before trying to add it. 

One possible fix strategy is to add a check in the `with` method to ensure that the field type is supported in the current Chronology. If it is not, throw an IllegalArgumentException. An additional test case should be written to verify this fix. 

The corrected piece of code would look like this:
```
public Partial with(DateTimeFieldType fieldType, int value) {
    if (fieldType == null || !fieldType.isSupported(iChronology)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("The field type must not be null or unsupported");
    }
    ...
}
```

Please note, the exact fix may vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the application.
