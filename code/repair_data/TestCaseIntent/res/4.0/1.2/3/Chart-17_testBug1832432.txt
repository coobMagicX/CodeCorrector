Intent: The purpose of the code and test is to implement and verify the clone() method for the TimeSeries class. This allows creating a duplicate (clone) of an existing TimeSeries object. The test aims to ensure that the cloned object is not the same as the original (i.e., they do not reference the same memory space) but they are of the same class and have equal content. It also checks the independence of the objects i.e., changes to one object should not affect the other.

Fix strategy: The specific line that failed is where the clone() method is called. Likely, the clone method might not be correctly implemented in the TimeSeries class. A suitable strategy to fix this issue would be to review and correct the implementation of createCopy() method which is used in the clone() method. Ensure that it creates a correct deep copy of the TimeSeries object. Also, make sure the equals() method is properly overridden in the TimeSeries class to compare the content of the objects and not their references.
