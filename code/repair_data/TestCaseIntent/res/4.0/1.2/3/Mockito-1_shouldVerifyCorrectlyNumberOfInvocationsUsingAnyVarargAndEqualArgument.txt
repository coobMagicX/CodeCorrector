Intent: The purpose of the source code appears to be to handle and capture arguments from given invocations. If the invoked method accepts variable arguments (varargs), the code should capture each argument separately. If the method does not accept varargs, it should capture the arguments in their original form. The failed test case is intended to verify that the newRow method of the table object was called correctly with variable arguments.

Fix strategy: The failure is due to an UnsupportedOperationException being thrown whenever a method with variable arguments (varargs) is invoked. This is not the expected behavior as the code should be able to handle methods with varargs. The UnsupportedOperationException is being thrown at line 4 in the code. The fix strategy would involve removing this exception throw and implementing code to handle varargs. The if clause that checks if the method accepts varargs should be completed with logic that properly captures the variable arguments.
