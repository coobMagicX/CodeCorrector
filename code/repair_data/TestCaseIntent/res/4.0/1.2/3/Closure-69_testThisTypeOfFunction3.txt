Intent: The purpose of the source code is to validate and ensure the correct usage of function calls in JavaScript. The code checks certain conditions such as whether a function can be called, whether non-native constructors are directly called, and whether functions with explicit 'this' types are called correctly. If these conditions are not met, an error report is generated.

Fix Strategy: The failed test case indicates that a function that should be called with a "this" type is not called correctly. The error occurs because the function `f` is called without any context. In JavaScript, the value of `this` inside a function is determined by how the function is called. When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` is set to the object the method is called on.

One way to fix the test case could be to call the function `f` as a method of an object, in order to provide a "this" type. Here's an example of how you could modify the test:

```java
public void testThisTypeOfFunction3() throws Exception {
    testTypes(
        "/** @constructor */ function F() {}" +
        "F.prototype.bar = function() {};" +
        "var f = new F(); f.bar();",
        "\"function (this:F): undefined\" must be called with a \"this\" type");
}
```
In this code, we create a new object `f` of type `F` and then call the method `bar` on it. This provides the correct "this" type.
