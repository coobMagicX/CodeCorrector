Intent: The intent and purpose of this source code is to provide a string representation of a JavaScript object type, particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes. The code includes logic for pretty-printing the object properties in a sorted order, up to a maximum limit defined by `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES`.

Fix strategy: The test case `testLongToString` is failing at the `assertEquals` lines where it's checking whether the string representation of the record matches the expected string. The failure might be due to the `toStringHelper` method not correctly formatting the properties of the JavaScript object type. Investigate the exact string being returned and how it differs from the expected string. 

The fix could involve modifying the `toStringHelper` method to correctly format the properties of the object type. Additionally, ensure that the `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` constant is correctly set to the maximum number of properties that should be displayed in the pretty-printed string. If the constant is incorrectly set, it might be causing the method to truncate the string before all the properties have been added.
