Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation using matchers. If a matcher captures arguments, it captures from the invocation's argument at a specific position. If the method of the invocation is a vararg method, it captures from the array of raw arguments. If a matcher is a vararg matcher (handles variable-length argument lists), it captures from each element in the array.

The failing test case is intended to check if the method stubs are evaluated in their latest order of stubbing. It creates two stubs for the `objectReturningMethod` and checks if the returned values are as expected.

Fix strategy: The error seems to occur at the line where the `objectReturningMethod` is stubbed with a specific argument (200). It's likely the issue has to do with how the argument is captured and processed in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. 

We should revise the method to handle argument capturing correctly for specific argument values. A possible fix could involve verifying if the argument type matches the matcher's expected type before capturing it. If the argument is not of the expected type (i.e., if `isA(Integer.class)` fails), an exception could be thrown or the argument could be skipped to avoid unexpected behavior.

Also, check the implementation of `objectReturningMethod` and `toReturn` methods to make sure they are correctly stubbing the method and returning the desired values. Ensure that `toReturn` method is correctly associated with the stubbed method.
