Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a specific value to a given date, considering certain edge cases such as leap years. It has been designed to handle dates in different formats and ensure that the addition operation works accurately.

Fix strategy: The failed test case indicates that the issue is with subtracting days from a date. The test case is attempting to subtract -1 days from the date 29th February of a leap year. It seems that the 'minusDays' method is not correctly handling the leap year edge case. 

One possible fix strategy would be to review and correct the 'minusDays' method to ensure that it correctly handles leap years and the subtraction of negative days. Specifically, the method needs to consider the case of subtracting -1 days from 29th February, which should result in a date of 1st March.
