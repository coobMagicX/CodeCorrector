Intent: The intent of the source code is to handle method invocations with both non-variable and variable arguments. It checks if the method is a variable argument method and if so, throws an exception. Otherwise, it iterates over the matchers and if a matcher can capture arguments, it captures the argument at the current position. After that, it checks again if the matcher can capture arguments and if the number of raw arguments in the invocation is greater than the current position. If this condition is met, it checks if the argument at the current position is a variable argument and if the matcher is a variable argument matcher. If so, it captures all the variable arguments. If not, it captures the argument at the current position.

Fix strategy: The source code fails because it throws an UnsupportedOperationException when it encounters a variable argument method, but the test case is expecting it to handle variable arguments. The fix strategy would be to remove the exception throwing and instead implement support for variable argument methods. This can be done by moving the code that handles non-variable arguments into the else branch of the if statement, and adding a new branch to handle variable arguments. In this new branch, the code should iterate over the variable arguments and capture them just like it does for non-variable arguments. Also, it should ensure that the return statement only gets executed if all variable arguments have been captured.
