Intent: The source code is intended to implement an optimization method known as Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is used for solving non-linear least squares problems. The `doOptimize()` method iteratively optimizes a given function to find the point that minimizes the function's value. The failed test case `testMinpackFreudensteinRoth()` is intended to test the optimization of the Freudenstein Roth function with different initial points.

Fix strategy: Since the error message and failed lines are not provided, we can't identify a specific issue. However, common issues for failing tests could be due to incorrect assertions, incorrect test setup, or bugs in the code under test.

1. Check the assertion in `minpackTest()`. Make sure the expected and actual results are correctly defined.
2. Check if the `FreudensteinRothFunction` is correctly implemented and is working as expected. 
3. Check if the initial parameters passed to the `FreudensteinRothFunction` in the test cases are correct.
4. Debug the `doOptimize()` method to identify if any issues exist in the implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
