Intent: The purpose of this code is to evaluate if a certain node in an abstract syntax tree (AST) represents a local value based on a provided predicate. This is done by switching over the different types of tokens that can represent a node and applying different logic for each type. 

Fix strategy: The failing test case is not giving much information about what's causing the failure. However, looking at the code, it seems that the method `evaluatesToLocalValue()` is not handling all potential cases of node types (specifically the `Token.NEW` case) correctly. The method currently returns `true` for `Token.NEW` regardless of its context which might not be accurate in all situations. To fix this, we need to add more specific logic to the `Token.NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue()` method. This logic should determine if the value was ever aliased from inside the constructor similar to the `callHasLocalResult()`. If it was, the method should return `false`. If not, it should return `true`. For this, we might need to add a new method similar to `callHasLocalResult()` but for `Token.NEW`.
