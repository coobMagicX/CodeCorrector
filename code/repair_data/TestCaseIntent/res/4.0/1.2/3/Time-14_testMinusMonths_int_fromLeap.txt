Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a certain value to a specific field of a readable partial object, which represents a partial date without a time zone. This is typically used for implementing date fields, such as month-day, in a calendar system. The code accounts for leap years and ensures that adding months to a date like 2004-02-29 results in a correct date. 

The failed test case is designed to test the functionality of subtracting months from a leap day date. 

Fix strategy: The failure is happening at the line where the `minusMonths` method is being called. This suggests that the issue might be with the calculation when subtracting months. The `add` method in the source code should handle both adding and subtracting of months (since subtracting is essentially adding a negative number). One possibility is that the `add` method might not be handling negative numbers properly. 

To fix this, we need to check the implementation of the `add` method, especially focusing on how it handles negative numbers. If it doesn't handle them correctly, we need to add a condition to handle this case. If the `add` method appears to be working correctly, then we would need to look at the `minusMonths` method next, as that might be where the problem lies.
