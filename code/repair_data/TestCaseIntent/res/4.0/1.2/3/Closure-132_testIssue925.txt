Intent: The aim of this code is to optimize and minimize the operations of a given programming code. It simplifies if-else structures, combines nested if-else structures, removes repeated statements, and converts specific structures into more simplified expressions. The function takes a Node object as a parameter, modifies it based on the optimization rules, and returns the optimized Node.

Fix strategy: The failed test cases involve operations that have side-effects (--y and x++). The code fails to handle these cases correctly while transforming the if-else statements into ternary expressions. Therefore, the fix should involve checking for such operations and handle the transformation accordingly. We must ensure that the side-effects of these operations are preserved after the transformation. This might require a change in the way the ternary expressions are formed in these cases, or skipping the transformation for these cases altogether if it's not possible to preserve the side-effects.
