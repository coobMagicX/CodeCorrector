Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation and pass each argument to an instance of 'CapturesArguments' if the current matcher in the iteration is an instance of 'CapturesArguments'.

Fix strategy: The test case fails at the line 'invocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(invocation);'. This could be due to a mismatch in the number of arguments in the invocation and the number of matchers. To fix this, we should add a check to ensure that the number of arguments in the invocation matches the number of matchers. If they don't match, we should throw an exception or handle this scenario appropriately according to the program's requirements. This will ensure that the 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' is not thrown, which could be causing the test case to fail.
