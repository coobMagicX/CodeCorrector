Intent: The purpose of the source code is to append a quoted string onto a StringBuffer. The string is taken as a pattern from a specified position. If the escaping is on and the character at the start of the pattern is a QUOTE, it appends a QUOTE to the StringBuffer. It also handles instances of escaped quotes and throws an exception if a quoted string is not properly terminated.

Fix Strategy: The failed test case suggests that there might be an issue with how the method handles escaped quotes. There might be an off-by-one error or similar problem in the code that handles this case. 

The failure occurs when creating an instance of the ExtendedMessageFormat with a pattern containing an escaped quote. The expected result of the format operation does not match the actual result. 

To fix this, adjustment of the indices when appending escaped quotes to the StringBuffer might be necessary. It might also be necessary to adjust the condition that checks if the pattern string starts with an escaped quote. 

Additionally, reviewing the ExtendedMessageFormat class could be beneficial to ensure it correctly interprets the modified pattern string.
