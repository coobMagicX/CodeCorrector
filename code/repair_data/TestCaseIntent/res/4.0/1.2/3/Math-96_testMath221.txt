Intent: The purpose of the equals() method in the source code is to compare the current Complex object with another Complex object for equality. It checks if both the real and imaginary parts of the two Complex numbers are equal. If they are, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The failing test case, testMath221(), is meant to validate the multiplication of two Complex numbers. It checks if the multiplication of the second Complex number (0,1) by the third Complex number (-1,0) results in the first Complex number (0,-1).

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be in the multiplication method, not in the equals() method. The multiplication of the Complex number (0,1) by (-1,0) should indeed yield (0,-1), but the test case failure suggests that it does not.

The fix would be to revisit the multiply() method of the Complex class, ensuring it correctly computes the multiplication of two Complex numbers. The formula to multiply two complex numbers (a + bi) and (c + di) is (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. Use this formula to correctly implement the multiply() method. After this, the failing test case should pass.
