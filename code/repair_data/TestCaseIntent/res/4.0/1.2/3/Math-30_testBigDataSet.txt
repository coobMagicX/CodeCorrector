Intent: The provided source code is a method to calculate the p-value for the Mann-Whitney U test, which is a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that two samples are likely to derive from the same population. The test is used in statistics to test whether two independent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution. The failed test case "testBigDataSet" is creating two large datasets and running the Mann-Whitney U test on them, expecting to receive a p-value greater than 0.1.

Fix strategy: The failure is occurring at the assertion line where the result is expected to be greater than 0.1. If the result is consistently lesser than 0.1, it means the two datasets are statistically different. However, since the two datasets in the test case are almost identical (only differing by 1 for each corresponding element), the expected result should be a high p-value. 

Therefore, it would be worth investigating the "mannWhitneyUTest" method to ensure that it's calculating the U statistic and p-value correctly. If the method is correct, we need to examine the formation of the datasets in the test case. If the datasets are not formed as intended, it could lead to a low p-value. Also, consider increasing the sample size, as small sample sizes can lead to inaccurate results. 

Finally, it might be worth revisiting the expected result. Are we sure we should expect a p-value greater than 0.1 in this case? If the assertion is incorrect, it should be updated to reflect the expected outcome of the test.
