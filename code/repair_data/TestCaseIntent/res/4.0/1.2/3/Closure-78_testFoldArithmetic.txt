Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and bitwise operations on the given nodes. It also handles edge cases for division by zero and arithmetic operations involving NaN and Infinity.

Fix strategy: The specific line of failure suggests that division by zero is not handled properly in the test cases. In the source code, the method is designed to throw an error when division by zero is detected. However, in the test case, it is expected to perform division by 0. Therefore, the test case should be corrected to expect an error when division by 0 is attempted or the source code should be updated to handle division by 0 differently, for instance, by returning Infinity. Moreover, in the source code, the method is returning null when the operands might be strings but in the test cases, this isn't being accounted for. Therefore, the test cases should also include checks to handle scenarios when operands might be strings.
