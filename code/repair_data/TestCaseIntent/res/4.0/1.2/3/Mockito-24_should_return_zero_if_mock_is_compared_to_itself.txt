Intent: The intent of the source code seems to be defining a method that handles invocation of methods on a mock object. It handles specific methods such as 'toString' and 'compareTo' in a special way, while for other methods, it returns a default value based on the return type. The failed test case is intended to check if the 'compareTo' method on a mock object returns 0 when the object is compared to itself.

Fix strategy: The problem lies in the 'compareTo' handling section of the source code. It is returning 1 regardless of whether the objects compared are the same or not. The fix is to add a check to see if the references of the objects being compared are the same. If they are, return 0, otherwise return 1. The modified compareTo handling code would look something like this:

```java
if (methodsGuru.isCompareToMethod(invocation.getMethod())) {
    Object mock = invocation.getMock();
    if (invocation.getArguments()[0] == mock) {
        // return 0 if references are the same
        return 0;
    } else {
        // return some other value because they are not the same
        return 1;
    }
}
```

This fix will ensure that the 'compareTo' method returns 0 when the mock object is compared to itself, thus making the test case pass.
