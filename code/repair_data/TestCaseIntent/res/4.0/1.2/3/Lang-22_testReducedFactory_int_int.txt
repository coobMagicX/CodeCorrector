Intent: The intent of this code is to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers as part of the process of reducing a fraction to its simplest form. The test cases are intended to check the correct reduction of fractions under various conditions, such as zero numerator or denominator, positive and negative numbers, and extreme values.

Fix strategy: The specific line that failed is testing the reduction of a fraction with extremely large negative numerator (Integer.MIN_VALUE) and a denominator of 2. The expected numerator after reduction is Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2, but the actual returned value does not match this. This suggests that there might be an overflow error occurring in the gcd calculation when dealing with large negative numbers. 

One possible fix strategy would be to handle the case of large negative numbers separately to prevent overflow. If the input numbers are close to the limits of the integer range, we could use long type for some intermediate calculations to avoid overflow. Alternatively, we could add a check for potential overflow and throw an exception if it is detected. This would prevent incorrect results from being returned, but would also require the calling code to handle the exception.
