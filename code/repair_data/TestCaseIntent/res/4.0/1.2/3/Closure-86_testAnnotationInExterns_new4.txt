Intent: The purpose of the provided code is to evaluate a given node based on its type. It returns true if the node is of a certain type, otherwise it throws an exception. It is part of a larger system that most likely processes and interacts with these nodes.

Failed test cases indicate that there might be an issue with how objects created with `new` are processed. According to the comment in the code, the method should return true if it's sure the value was never aliased from inside the constructor (similar to callHasLocalResult), but the TODO suggests this hasn't been implemented yet.

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be related to the handling of the `Token.NEW` case. The current implementation simply returns `true` without considering whether the value was ever aliased. To fix this, the `Token.NEW` case needs to be revised to correctly check if the value was ever aliased from inside the constructor. This could possibly be done by implementing a method similar to `callHasLocalResult` for `new` expressions. It is also important to investigate how the `new` keyword interacts with the rest of the system to ensure the correct behavior is implemented.
