Intent: The intent of this code is to test the 'equals' method of the 'ShapeList' class. The 'equals' method should return 'true' if the two objects being compared are equal and 'false' otherwise. In this case, the test is checking if two 'ShapeList' objects with the same shapes are considered equal by the 'equals' method.

Fix strategy: The 'equals' method in the 'ShapeList' class is not correctly checking for equality of the shapes within the lists. Instead of calling 'super.equals(obj)', the method should iterate through the shapes in the list and use their 'equals' methods to check for equality. Modify the 'equals' method in the 'ShapeList' class to correctly check for equality of the shapes within the lists.
