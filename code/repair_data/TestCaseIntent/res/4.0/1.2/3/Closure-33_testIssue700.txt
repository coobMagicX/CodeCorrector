Intent: The purpose of this code is to match constraints on anonymous types in the form of record type objects. The code checks if the constraint object is a record type and then iterates over its properties. For each property, if the property type is not declared, it infers the type and assigns it. If the property itself doesn't exist, it gets the least supertype of the property type and defines it inferred.

Fix strategy: Looking at the failed test cases, the problem lies in the handling of nested properties. The function 'temp2' passes 'opt_data.activity' to 'temp1', however, 'temp1' expects a parameter with a property 'text', which 'opt_data.activity' does not have. A possible fix strategy would be to add checks for nested properties in the source code. Also, the type inference should be able to handle complex types such as (boolean|number|string|null|Object) correctly.
