Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a value to statistical summary data. It increments the sum, sum of squares, minimum, maximum, sum of logs, second moment, mean, variance, and geometric mean of the data. If the mean, variance or geometric mean have been overridden, they need to be incremented as well. The intent of the failed test case is to test if the `setVarianceImpl` method properly sets the variance implementation to use the "population variance" and if this variance is correctly calculated when values are added.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be on the assertion line where the calculated variance from the overridden `Variance` class doesn't match with the variance obtained from `stats.getVariance()`. It could be because `stats.getVariance()` is not using the overridden variance implementation. To fix this, ensure that `stats.getVariance()` uses the correct `Variance` implementation when it has been overridden. If the override is working correctly, check the computation of variance in both the `Variance` class and the `getVariance` method.
