Intent: The purpose of this code is to analyze the control flow in a JavaScript program. It computes the follow node of a given node in the program's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The follow node is the next node in the control flow of the program. This function is important in understanding the control flow and logic of a JavaScript program.

Fix strategy: The failed test case implies that there might be an issue with the handling of the `try`, `finally` statement in the source code. Specifically, in the case where there is a return statement within the `try` block. 

The problem could be in the handling of the `TRY` case in the switch statement in the source code. A debug strategy would be to add logs to understand how the control is flowing in the test case and then analyze it to understand where the problem lies. 

Once the problem is identified, the code should be updated to handle the control flow correctly in this scenario. This might involve changing how the follow node is computed when a return statement is encountered within a `try` block that also has a `finally` block.
