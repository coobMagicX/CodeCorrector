Intent: The intent and purpose of this code is to get the data range of a given axis in a chart. This involves identifying whether the axis is a domain axis or a range axis, collecting the datasets mapped to the axis, and combining the ranges of these datasets. The code also includes annotations in the data bounds. The failed test case is trying to draw range gridlines on a chart with a null renderer.

Fix strategy: The failing line `plot.setRenderer(null);` is causing an issue because the code does not handle a null renderer properly. When the renderer is null, the code tries to access methods on it, causing a NullPointerException. A fix strategy is to add null checks before calling methods on the renderer. This can be done by enclosing the block of code where the renderer is used in an if statement that checks if the renderer is not null. If the renderer is null, the program can either skip the operation or throw an informative error message.
