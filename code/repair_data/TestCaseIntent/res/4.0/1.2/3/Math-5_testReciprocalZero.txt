Intent: The intent of this code is to implement a method that calculates the reciprocal of a complex number. The reciprocal of a complex number is computed differently based on whether the complex number is NaN (Not a Number), zero, infinity, or a normal complex number. 

Fix strategy: The failing test case indicates that the reciprocal of zero is not correctly handled. According to the mathematical definition, the reciprocal of zero should be infinity. However, the current implementation returns NaN when both the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number are zero. Therefore, the fix strategy would be to modify the condition where the reciprocal of zero is handled in the reciprocal() method. Specifically, when both the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number are zero, the method should return Infinity instead of NaN.
