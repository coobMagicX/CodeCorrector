Intent: The purpose of the source code is to check whether two method invocations are the same by comparing the invoked methods. The failed test case is intended to verify if the iterator method of an iterable object has been called.

Fix strategy: The issue appears to be that the method comparison in the 'hasSameMethod' function is not working properly when generics are involved, as indicated by the comment in the source code. If the issue is indeed due to the use of generics, the fix could involve improving the method comparison to handle generic methods correctly. This could potentially be achieved by comparing the method names and parameter types instead of using the 'equals' method on the Method instances. However, without knowing more about the 'Method' class and the 'Invocation' class, it's hard to provide a specific fix strategy. It could be possible that the 'Invocation' class or the way the 'Method' instances are created needs to be adjusted.
