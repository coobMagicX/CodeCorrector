Intent: The purpose of the source code is to perform a check on the visibility of a property in JavaScript objects. It checks if a property can be accessed or overridden based on its visibility modifiers (private, protected, public). It also handles different cases such as accessing the property from the same file, overriding the property in a subclass, and accessing the property from inside a subclass.

Fix strategy: The failed test case indicates an issue with overriding a private property with a non-private property in a different file. The source code should be modified to handle this specific case. Currently, the condition that checks if the visibility of an override is the same as the visibility of the original property doesn't handle the case where the override is non-private and the original property is private. This condition should be updated to handle this case correctly.
