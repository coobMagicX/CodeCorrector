Intent: The purpose of the function gcd(int u, int v) is to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the given two integers 'u' and 'v' using the Binary GCD algorithm. The Binary GCD algorithm is an optimized version of the Euclidean algorithm that reduces the number of divisions.

Fix strategy: The failure occurred at the line assertEquals(3 * (1<<15), MathUtils.gcd(3 * (1<<20), 9 * (1<<15))). This indicates that the function is not able to correctly compute the gcd of larger numbers. Looking at the code, it seems the possible issue could be in the calculation of 't'. As 'u' and 'v' are both negative, the computation (v - u) / 2 might be resulting in overflow for larger numbers. 
So, one fix could be to ensure that the calculations are done with long data type to prevent integer overflow. This will involve changing the variable types to long and updating the method signature accordingly. 

Another possible fix could be to add checks to prevent overflow. This could be done by checking if the values of 'u' and 'v' are in the range where the overflow may occur, and then adjusting the values or the algorithm accordingly. 

Please note that the actual fix would require further investigation and testing.
