Intent: The intent of this function is to check if an object can be inlined. It verifies a list of references to check if they are valid for inlining. It looks for object literal assignments and if it finds an acceptable assignment, it returns true. It also checks for possible incorrect cases like self-referential assignments and ES5 getters/setters, in which cases it returns false.

Fix Strategy: The failed test case suggests that the code doesn't handle deleted properties correctly. The code currently assumes that if a property isn't defined on an object, then the value is undefined. However, it does not take into account that properties could have been deleted. 

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the code to handle deleted properties. We can keep track of deleted properties in a separate set and in the validation loop, we check if the property is in this set. If it is, we return false. 

The fix strategy could look something like this:

1. Create a new set to store deleted properties: `Set<String> deletedProperties = Sets.newHashSet();`
2. Before the validation loop, add a check if the property is deleted: `if (deletedProperties.contains(propName)) return false;`
3. Inside the loop where we check for valid properties, add the property name to the deletedProperties set if it is not valid: `if (!validProperties.contains(propName)) { if (NodeUtil.isVarOrSimpleAssignLhs(parent, gramps)) { validProperties.add(propName); } else { deletedProperties.add(propName); return false; } }`
