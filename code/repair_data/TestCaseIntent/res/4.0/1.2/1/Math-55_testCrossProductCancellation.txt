Intent: The intent of the source code is to compute the cross product of two 3D vectors. The cross product of two vectors results in a third vector that is orthogonal (at right angles) to the original vectors. The failed test case is trying to validate the cross product computation when particularly large or particularly small numbers are used, with an expectation of getting a specific vector as result. 

Fix strategy: Based on the information provided, it seems the problem exists with the calculation of the cross product. The computations in the return statement of the crossProduct method might be suffering from a precision loss due to the large or small magnitude of numbers involved. The comments in the source code mention rescaling vectors and computing an approximation of v1.v2 / v2.v2, but these calculations are not implemented in the provided code. Thus, the fix should involve implementing these additional calculations to manage the precision issues and ensure correct computation of the cross product.
