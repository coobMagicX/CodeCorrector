Intent: The intent of the source code is to parse a string containing a date into a DateTime object using a specified pattern and locale. The test case is intended to validate the functionality of the parser by checking if the parser can correctly parse the string "2 29" into the date February 29th and if the parser returns the new position in the parsed string. 

Fix Strategy: The issue seems to be with the parser not being able to parse "2 29" as February 29th correctly and/or not returning the new position in the parsed string as 4. The problem may lie in how the parser handles leap years. The year 2004 is a leap year and February 29th exists in it. 

The fix strategy will involve debugging the parser.parseInto() and bucket.computeMillis() methods to ensure they correctly handle leap years and parse the date string correctly. Additionally, the parser.parseInto() method should return the correct new position in the parsed string. If this is not happening, it needs to be fixed as well. 

The DateTimeParserBucket's getOffsetInteger() and getZone() methods may also need to be checked to ensure they are returning the correct values. If these are incorrect, it could prevent the parser from parsing the date string correctly. 

Finally, the setChronology() and setZone() methods of the instant object may need to be debugged to ensure they are setting the chronology and time zone correctly. If these are not being set correctly, it may also cause the parser to parse the date string incorrectly.
