Intent: As previously identified, the intent of the test is to correctly parse type expressions involving constructors, with particular attention to distinguishing different types of constructors (e.g., general vs. nominal).

Repair strategy: The correct strategy involves modifying the parseContextTypeExpression method to handle different token types more effectively, particularly the JsDocToken.QMARK token, which represents an unknown type (?). The patch shows the introduction of a condition to specifically handle JsDocToken.QMARK by returning a new node type Token.QMARK. Moreover, for other tokens, the method was changed to call parseBasicTypeExpression instead of parseTypeName, suggesting a more comprehensive approach to parsing different basic types, which might include improved handling of constructor annotations. This change supports the interpretation of different syntactic elements that were not adequately handled in the original implementation.
