Intent: The intent of this source code is to infer the types of a function call by using a template type map. If there are template types, it tries to infer them from the parameters. It replaces all template types with their inferred types or with UNKNOWN if no replacement could be found. It then updates the types of the function call and its target. The function returns whether any changes were made during the replacement process.

Fix strategy: The error is occurring on the testTypes function call. It seems like the issue is that the function's return type is not as expected. The function C.prototype.method is expected to return a type 'T', but in the test case it's returning '?'. To fix this, you should check the inferTemplateTypesFromParameters and TemplateTypeReplacer functions, as the issue might lie there. You need to ensure that these functions are correctly inferring and replacing the template types. It's also important to validate the input to the testTypes function. Specifically, the type returned by new C().method(1) should match with the type 'T'.
