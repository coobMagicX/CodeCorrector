Intent: The purpose of the source code is to evaluate whether a given node value is local or not based on various conditions and node types. It takes in two parameters, a node value and a predicate of local nodes. The function checks the type of the given node value and applies various conditions to return a boolean value indicating whether the node value is local or not.

Fix strategy: From the failed test case, it appears that the issue might lie in the handling of the 'setLocation' method within the 'F' object in the 'checkMarkedCalls' function. The function does not correctly identify the locality of 'this.location'. One potential fix could be modifying the 'Token.CALL' case in the switch statement to correctly handle this type of method call. This could involve adding additional checks in the 'Token.CALL' case to handle situations where a method is being called on an object, and properly evaluate the locality of the object and the method being called. Additionally, error handling can be improved to provide more descriptive error messages, helping to identify the cause of the exception when the function encounters an unexpected node.
