Intent: The intent of the source code is to compare two double values for equality. It checks if both are NaN (not a number) or if they are equal to each other. The failed test case is trying to compare two arrays of double values for equality, not just single double values, which is beyond the scope of the source code's functionality. 

Fix strategy: Amend the source code to handle arrays of double values, not just single values. This could involve iterating over the arrays and comparing each pair of values with the existing method. Also, the code needs to handle the special case where both arrays are null, where it should return true. Finally, the code should return false if the lengths of the arrays are different. Here is a suggestion for how to fix the code:

```java
public static boolean equals(double[] x, double[] y) {
    if (x == null || y == null) return x == y;
    if (x.length != y.length) return false;
    for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (!(Double.isNaN(x[i]) && Double.isNaN(y[i])) || x[i] != y[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
