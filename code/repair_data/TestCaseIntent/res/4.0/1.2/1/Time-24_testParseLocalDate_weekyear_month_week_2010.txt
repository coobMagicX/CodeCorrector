Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to compute milliseconds from a given date/time string. It takes two parameters: a boolean to indicate whether to reset fields and a string which represents the date/time. It tries to parse the input text into a date/time and calculate the milliseconds from it. If the parsing encounters any illegal field value or time zone offset transition, it throws an exception. 

The provided failed test case is intended to test the parsing of a local date in the "weekyear-month-week" format. The date is based on the Gregorian-Julian (GJ) calendar chronology. The test case expects the parsed date to be January 4, 2010, but it fails.

Fix strategy: The test case seems to fail because the provided date string "2010-01-01" does not align with the expected date (January 4, 2010). It seems like there might be a confusion in the interpretation of the format "xxxx-MM-ww". If "ww" is intended to represent the week of the year, "01" would refer to the first week, which might not necessarily start on the 1st of January. 

To fix this, the input string in the test case could be adjusted to align with the expected output date. Alternatively, if the format of the input string is correct, then the expected output date might need to be reconsidered. 

Another possible issue could be in the `computeMillis()` method itself, particularly in how it handles the parsing of date strings in the "weekyear-month-week" format. If this is the case, the method should be revised to correctly interpret this format.
