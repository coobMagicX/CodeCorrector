Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to check if a given string is a valid JavaScript identifier. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). 

The failed test case `testSame("a['A\u0004']")` is testing the function with a string that contains a control character (Unicode character '\u0004'). According to the JavaScript identifier naming rules, identifiers cannot contain control characters, so this test case is expected to fail.

Fix strategy: The code is behaving correctly according to the rules for JavaScript identifiers, but it seems the test case might be incorrect. The test case `testSame("a['A\u0004']")` should not expect the function `isJSIdentifier` to return true. Hence, the fix strategy should be to either remove this test case or correct the expected outcome of this test case.
