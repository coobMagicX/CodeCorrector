Intent: The test testGreatestSubtypeUnionTypes5 intends to verify the behavior of the getGreatestSubtype method when calculating the greatest common subtype of a union of error types (EVAL_ERROR_TYPE, URI_ERROR_TYPE) and a STRING_OBJECT_TYPE. The expected outcome is that there should be no common subtype between these types, hence the expected result is NO_OBJECT_TYPE.

Fix strategy: Given the failed assertion, the actual output of errUnion.getGreatestSubtype(STRING_OBJECT_TYPE) does not match the expected NO_OBJECT_TYPE. The potential source of error could be in the implementation of the meet method, which is likely involved in determining the greatest subtype. The logic within the meet method needs to be scrutinized, particularly how union types are handled and how subtype relationships are established.
