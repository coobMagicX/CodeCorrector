Intent: The intent of the source code is to compare two methods obtained from two different Invocation objects to see if they are equal. The intent of the test case is to mock an iterable and check if its iterator method is not null.

Fix strategy: 
The failed test case shows that the iterator method returns null. This may be because the iterable is not correctly mocked or the iterator method is not invoked correctly. The fix strategy is to ensure the iterable is mocked correctly and the iterator method is invoked correctly. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to debug the hasSameMethod function to ensure the methods being compared are as expected.
