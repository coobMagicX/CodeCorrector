Intent: The intent of this function is to find the starting index of a given string in the buffer. If the string is found, it returns the starting index; if the string is not found or if the starting index is greater than the size of the buffer, it returns -1.

Fix strategy: The issue in the test case seems to be that after deleting "three" from the StrBuilder, the test is expecting -1 as the result of indexOf("three") which is correct as "three" no longer exists in the StrBuilder. However, the test case is failing which means the indexOf function is not returning -1 as expected. 

We need to check if the deletion of the string "three" is done correctly. If that's not the issue, then we need to look at the condition where the function returns -1 when the string is not found.

In the indexOf function, there could be a problem with the outer loop where it scans the buffer to find the match for the input string. 

The limit for the loop is set to 'len', which is 'thisBuf.length - strLen'. This might cause the loop to terminate prematurely before it can find the string, thus returning -1. 

We can fix this by updating the loop limit to 'thisBuf.length' instead of 'len'. This will ensure the entire buffer is scanned for the input string. 

Also, updating the if condition 'if (strLen > size)' to 'if (strLen > thisBuf.length)' can fix the issue as it correctly checks if the input string length is greater than the buffer length.
