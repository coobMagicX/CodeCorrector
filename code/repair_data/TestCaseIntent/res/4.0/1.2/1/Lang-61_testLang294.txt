Intent: The source code is designed to find the index of a given string in a buffer, starting from a specified index. If the string is not found, it returns -1. The failed test case is intended to test the deleteAll function, which is supposed to delete all occurrences of a specified string in the StrBuilder object.

Fix strategy: The problem doesn't seem to be in the indexOf method, but rather in the deleteAll method, which is not presented in the provided code. The deleteAll method seems to be not working as expected, as it's not deleting all occurrences of "\n%BLAH%" in the StrBuilder object. The fix would be to debug and correct the deleteAll method to ensure it correctly deletes all occurrences of the specified string. If the deleteAll method relies on the indexOf method, make sure that it correctly handles the returned index, especially when indexOf returns -1.
