Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a certain value (like days, months, etc.) to a specific field in a date provided in the form of a ReadablePartial object. It's designed to handle situations where adding the value to a date could result in a date that doesn't exist, such as February 29, 2004 + 48 months (which should result in February 29, 2008).

Fix strategy: The failed test case indicates that the addition operation is not handling leap years correctly. The failure occurs when trying to add 1 day to February 29. The expected result is March 1, but the actual result doesn't match this. 

The problem might be in the 'add' method that takes 'instant' and 'valueToAdd' as input. It's possible that this method isn't correctly handling the case of adding days to February 29.

To fix this, the 'add' method should be updated to handle leap years correctly. When adding days to February 29, it should check if the resulting date would be in a leap year. If it is, then it should correctly set the date to February 29. If it's not a leap year, then it should set the date to March 1.
