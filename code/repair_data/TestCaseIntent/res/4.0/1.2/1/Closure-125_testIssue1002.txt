Intent: The purpose of this code is to define a function `visitNew` which seems to be part of a JavaScript type checker. It checks the type of a constructor and ensures that the parameters and instance are correctly typed. If not, it reports an error. 

The failed test case `testIssue1002` is designed to test whether the type checker can correctly handle constructors that implement the same interface.

Fix strategy: The test case failure could be due to a variety of reasons. It might be because the type checker is not correctly identifying the types of `A` and `B` as constructors implementing the same interface `I`, or because it is not correctly handling the comparison `A === B`.

To fix this, you should check the definition and usage of the function `getJSType` and `restrictByNotNullOrUndefined` in the `visitNew` method. Also, check the `visitParameterList` and `ensureTyped` methods to ensure they are working as expected. If they are not, you may need to modify these methods or the way they are called.

If the error is due to the comparison `A === B`, you might need to add additional logic to handle this case. This could involve checking whether `A` and `B` are both constructors that implement the same interface, and if so, treating them as equivalent for the purposes of type checking.
