Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to add two complex numbers. The method "add" accepts another complex number (rhs) as an argument. It first checks if this argument is null, and if it is not, it adds the real and imaginary parts of the argument to the real and imaginary parts of the current complex number respectively. It then returns a new Complex object with the new real and imaginary parts.

The intent of the failed test case, testAddNaN(), is to test the behavior of the add() method when adding a Complex number that contains NaN (Not a Number). The expectation is that if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, the result should also contain NaN in the corresponding part.

Fix strategy: The failed line indicates that the real part of the resulting complex number, when adding a complex number with NaN, is not NaN as expected. To fix this, you need to modify the add() method in the Complex class. 

Check if either the real or the imaginary parts of the input Complex number are NaN before performing addition. If either part is NaN, the corresponding part in the result should also be NaN. Here is a potential fix:

```java
public Complex add(Complex rhs) throws NullArgumentException {
    MathUtils.checkNotNull(rhs);

    double realPart = rhs.getReal();
    double imaginaryPart = rhs.getImaginary();

    if (Double.isNaN(realPart)) {
        realPart = Double.NaN;
    }

    if (Double.isNaN(imaginaryPart)) {
        imaginaryPart = Double.NaN;
    }

    return createComplex(real + realPart, imaginary + imaginaryPart);
}
```
This code first gets the real and imaginary parts of the rhs Complex number. If either part is NaN, it sets the corresponding part in the result to NaN before creating and returning the new Complex number.
