Intent: The purpose of the source code is to provide a custom equals method for the `ShapeList` class. The equality check first verifies if the input object is the same as the current instance, then checks if the input object is an instance of `ShapeList`. If both conditions fail, it returns false. However, it lacks a check for comparing the contents of the two `ShapeList` instances.

The intent of the failed test case is to verify the serialization and deserialization process of the `ShapeList` class. It populates a `ShapeList` object with rectangles, lines, and null shapes, serializes it to a byte array, then deserializes it back to a `ShapeList` object. The test fails at the assertion stage where it checks if the original and deserialized `ShapeList` objects are equal using the custom equals method.

Fix strategy: The custom equals method in the `ShapeList` class should be revised to compare the contents of the two lists. Right now, it only checks if the two objects are the same or if they are instances of the `ShapeList` class. A deep comparison of each shape in the lists should be added. This can be achieved by iterating over the shapes in the lists and calling the equal method on each pair of shapes. 

Additionally, the `ShapeList` class should implement `Serializable` interface to ensure objects of this class can be serialized and deserialized correctly. 

Also, it's better to handle exceptions properly in the test case to make sure any failure in serialization or deserialization process is properly reported.
