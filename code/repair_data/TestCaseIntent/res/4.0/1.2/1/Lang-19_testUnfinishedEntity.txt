Intent: The purpose of the source code is to unescape numeric HTML entities in a given CharSequence. It translates entities in decimal or hexadecimal format (prefixed by &# or &#x respectively) into their corresponding Unicode characters. 

Fix strategy: The failure is likely due to the lack of a semi-colon after the entity code in the test input. The source code expects a semi-colon to mark the end of the entity. In the test case, the input string "Test &#x30 not test" does not have a semi-colon after the entity code "&#x30", which is causing the failure. As per the expectation in the test case comment, the source code should support unfinished entities (entities without a semi-colon at the end).

One possible fix strategy would be to modify the while loop condition to also break if it has reached the end of the input string, thereby supporting unfinished entities. This modification should look like this:

```
while(end < seqEnd && input.charAt(end) != ';') {
    end++;
}
```

This change will ensure that the loop terminates either at the end of the sequence or at the next semi-colon, whichever comes first.
