Intent: The intent of this function is to calculate the linear combination of two arrays. It multiplies corresponding elements in arrays 'a' and 'b', and then sums up the results. If the result is NaN, it will execute a simpler version of the operation.

Fix strategy: The specific failure is in the test case where the length of array 'a' and 'b' is 1. The error occurs in the following lines of code:
    
    final double prodHighCur = prodHigh[0];
    double prodHighNext = prodHigh[1];

Here, the code is trying to access the second element of the array 'prodHigh', which doesn't exist when the length of the input arrays 'a' and 'b' is 1. 

To fix this error, we can add an if condition to check if the length of the arrays 'a' and 'b' is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element of 'prodHigh'. If the length is 1, we can skip the second for loop and directly calculate the result. This way, we avoid accessing an element that does not exist in the array 'prodHigh'. 

Additionally, it is good practice to check if arrays 'a' and 'b' are not null and contain at least one element before performing any operations on them.
