Intent: The purpose of this source code is to calculate and return the time in milliseconds from a given date string and other parameters. It's designed to handle different chronologies and time zones, and it also checks for invalid field values.

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be happening because the date parsing method is not interpreting "2010-01-01" as January 4th, 2010. This could be because of the pattern "yyyy-MM-ww" used in the DateTimeFormatter which is supposed to interpret "ww" as week of year, but it seems like it's not working as expected, and is instead interpreting the day as the first day of the month. The fix strategy here would be to adjust the date parsing pattern in the test case to correctly interpret the day as the first day of the week, or possibly adjust the implementation of the computeMillis method to handle this case.
