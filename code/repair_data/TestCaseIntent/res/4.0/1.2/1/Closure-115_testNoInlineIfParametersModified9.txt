Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to determine if a function call can be inlined directly. Inlining is an optimization that can potentially reduce the overhead of function calls by replacing the function call with the actual code of the function. The function checks if the inlining is possible by inspecting if the function has any side-effects, if the function is called via 'call' or 'apply', and if the function parameters or the arguments used in the function call may affect mutable state or have side-effects. 

Fix strategy: The test case "testNoInlineIfParametersModified9" has failed. It seems like the function is incorrectly inlining the function call even when the function modifies an array parameter. This suggests that the function is not correctly detecting side-effects in the function parameters. To fix this issue, we need to enhance the code to correctly detect side-effects when parameters are arrays. Specifically, the function needs to be updated to return `CanInlineResult.NO` when a function parameter is an array that gets modified.
