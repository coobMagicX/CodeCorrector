Intent: The purpose of this code is to calculate the chi-square statistic for the given observed and expected values. The chi-square statistic is a measure of how much the observed frequencies deviate from expected frequencies.

Fix strategy: It looks like the issue occurs at the assertEqual lines where the chi-square test statistic and p-value are being compared against expected values. The issue might be due to the precision of the double values which might be causing the test to fail. 

Here is the strategy to fix this issue:

1. Check the precision of the double values in the assertEquals method. If they are too precise, consider using a larger delta for comparison to avoid precision errors.

2. If the precision is not the issue, then you need to check the chiSquare method and chiSquareTest method implementation. Ensure that they are correctly computing the chi-square statistic and p-value. 

3. If the problem persists, then the expected values in the test case may be incorrect. In which case, you should verify the expected chi-square statistic and p-value and update the test case accordingly.
