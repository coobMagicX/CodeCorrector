Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to evaluate whether a node value is local. It operates on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of JavaScript code, examining different types of tokens (e.g., ASSIGN, COMMA, AND, OR, HOOK, INC, DEC, THIS, NAME, GETELEM, GETPROP, CALL, NEW, FUNCTION, REGEXP, ARRAYLIT, OBJECTLIT, IN, and others). The code checks if the value of each node is immutable, applies a local predicate, or evaluates to a local value, depending on the token type. 

The failed test case 'testLocalizedSideEffects9' is testing whether the return of a locally modified object is treated as a global side effect. The test case fails on the line where it checks marked calls with a constructor function 'A' and a function 'f'.

Fix strategy: The failure indicates that the function 'f' is not recognized as having a local effect, which could be due to the constructor 'A' not being properly handled in the 'evaluatesToLocalValue' function in the 'Token.NEW' case. The fix could involve refining the handling of 'Token.NEW' cases in the 'evaluatesToLocalValue' function. This could include a more detailed analysis of the constructor to determine if the constructed object has been locally modified. The fix could also involve updating the 'callHasLocalResult' method to better handle cases where a local object has been modified.
