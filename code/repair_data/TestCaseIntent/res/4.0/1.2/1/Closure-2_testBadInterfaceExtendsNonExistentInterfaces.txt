Intent: The purpose of this code is to check for conflicting properties in various interfaces. It does this by iterating through the properties of the given interface type and comparing them with a provided map of properties. If it finds an unequal match, it reports an error. Additionally, it recursively checks for conflicts in extended interfaces.

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be occurring in the test for cases where an interface extends non-existent interfaces. The failure points to the 'testTypes' method, suggesting that the expected warnings and the actual warnings from the code check do not match. To fix this, there should be a check for the existence of the interface before its properties are retrieved and compared. If the interface does not exist, an error should be thrown. This can be done by adding a null check for 'implicitProto' after it's declared. If it's null, then 'interfaceType' is a proxy to a non-existent object, and an error should be reported.
