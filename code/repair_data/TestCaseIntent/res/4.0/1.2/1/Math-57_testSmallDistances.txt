Intent: The intent of the source code is to implement the k-means++ algorithm for clustering data points. The failed test case, `testSmallDistances`, is designed to test whether the algorithm can correctly choose initial cluster centers, particularly in cases where there are many repeated points and only one unique point.

Fix strategy: The test case `testSmallDistances` failed at the line `assertTrue(uniquePointIsCenter);`. This suggests that the unique point was not selected as one of the cluster centers as expected. This could be due to the randomness in the `chooseInitialCenters` method. 

One potential fix strategy is to modify the `chooseInitialCenters` algorithm to ensure that it prioritizes unique points when choosing initial centers. This could be done by calculating the distance of each point from all other points and ranking them by their minimum distance. The points with the highest minimum distance (i.e., the most unique points) would be chosen as initial centers.

However, this strategy may not be in line with the k-means++ algorithm's design, which is based on probabilities proportionate to the square of the distances. A more consistent fix might involve adjusting the test case to accommodate the randomness of the algorithm, such as by running the test multiple times and checking that the unique point is chosen as a center in a reasonable number of cases. 

It's also worth reviewing the implementation of `getNearestCluster` and `distanceFrom` methods to ensure they're functioning correctly, as these are critical to the operation of the clustering algorithm.
