Intent: The intent of this code is to calculate the cumulative probability of a normal distribution given a certain value 'x'. The test case is designed to check if the cumulative probability is calculated correctly for extreme values, both positive and negative. The test is ensuring that the cumulative probability for values less than the mean is greater than 0 and less than 1, and for values greater than the mean, it is ensuring the cumulative probability is nearly 1.

Fix strategy: From the failed line, it appears that the cumulative probability for negative values (-i) is not being calculated correctly. One possible issue could be the handling of negative values in the "Erf.erf" function. It would be worth checking the implementation of this function for potential issues. If the problem lies there, the fix strategy would be to correct the "Erf.erf" function to handle negative inputs correctly. Otherwise, the issue could be in the calculation itself in the "cumulativeProbability" function. In that case, the fix would be to adjust the formula used to calculate the cumulative probability.
