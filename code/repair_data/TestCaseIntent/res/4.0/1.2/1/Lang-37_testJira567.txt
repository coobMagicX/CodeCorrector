Intent: The intent of this method is to combine two arrays into one. It's a generic method that can take arrays of any object type. It clones the array if one of them is null and if not, it creates a new array of the same type as the first array and copies the contents of both arrays into it. The failed test case was trying to test a condition where two arrays of incompatible types are passed to the method. 

Fix strategy: The fix here would be to handle the case of incompatible types in the addAll method. Currently, the addAll method creates the joinedArray as the same type as array1, but if array2 contains a type that is not a subtype of array1's type, an ArrayStoreException will occur at runtime. A possible fix strategy would be to revise the code to create the joinedArray as the most specific super type of both array1 and array2's types. This would allow for elements of any subtype to be stored. Alternatively, we could throw an IllegalArgumentException if the types are incompatible, which would make the contract of the method clearer.
