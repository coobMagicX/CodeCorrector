Intent: The intent of the source code is to format a given date according to the rules applied in the 'applyRules' method. The failed test case 'testLang645' is intended to validate the correct formatting of a date in the Swedish locale. 

Fix strategy: The issue lies within the assertEquals line, where the expected string does not match the string returned by the format method. The cause of the failure might be due to incorrect rules being applied in the 'applyRules' method or an issue with locale-specific formatting. The fix strategy would be to investigate the 'applyRules' method and ensure it correctly applies the formatting rules for different locales. If the rules are correct, the issue might be with the 'getInstance' method not correctly setting the locale. Ensure the locale is correctly passed to and used in the 'getInstance' method.
