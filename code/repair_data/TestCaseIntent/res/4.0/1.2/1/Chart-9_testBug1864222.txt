Intent: The intent of the source code is to create a copy of a TimeSeries object with data points between the specified start and end RegularTimePeriods. The code checks if the start and end periods are valid, then creates a new TimeSeries instance with a subset of the original data series.

Fix strategy: The test fails because the method createCopy() throws a CloneNotSupportedException. This happens when the start and end periods do not contain any data points. The test case should instead test that the resultant TimeSeries copy is empty in such cases. The source code could be fixed by returning a new, empty TimeSeries instance when the start and end periods do not contain any data points in the original series, instead of throwing a CloneNotSupportedException. This could be achieved by removing the throws clause and handling the case internally.
