Intent: The purpose of this code is to generate a sample array of a particular size from a discrete distribution of objects. The test case is specifically designed to check whether the method is correctly generating a sample of the given size.

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be happening at the assertion which checks if the length of the sample generated is equal to 1. If the test fails, it means the sample method is not generating a sample of the correct size. One potential fix to this could be to ensure that the 'sample' method correctly generates a sample of the specified size. If the problem persists, consider checking the implementation of the 'sample' method and how the 'sampleSize' parameter is being used.
