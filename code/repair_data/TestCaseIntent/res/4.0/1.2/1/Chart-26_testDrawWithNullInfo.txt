Intent: The purpose and intent of this code is to draw labels on a plot. The labels can be drawn on any edge of the plot (top, bottom, left, right) and the labels are drawn rotated according to a specified angle. If the plot state is not null, an entity for the label is created and added to the entity collection of the plot. The code also handles the case where the label is null or an empty string.

The failed test case is designed to test the creation of a buffered image of a chart with a null PlotRenderingInfo object. The fact that it failed on `assertTrue(success)` suggests that a NullPointerException was thrown during the execution of the test, indicating that the code does not properly handle the null PlotRenderingInfo case.

Fix strategy: The NullPointerException is likely due to the fact that `plotState` is null, causing a NullPointerException when the code attempts to call `plotState.getOwner()`. This can be fixed by adding a null check on `plotState.getOwner()`. If it is null, the code should return or do whatever is appropriate in this context, such as throwing an exception or logging an error. This should be done before attempting to access `plotState.getOwner().getEntityCollection()`. Similarly, a null check should be added for `entities` before calling `entities.add()`.
