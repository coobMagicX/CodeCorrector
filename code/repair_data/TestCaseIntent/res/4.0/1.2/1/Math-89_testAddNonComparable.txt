Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a value to a collection. However, this value must be of Comparable type. The purpose of the test case is to ensure that adding a non-Comparable object to the collection throws an IllegalArgumentException. 

Fix strategy: The problem is that the source code is not checking if the input object is of a Comparable type before executing the addValue method. This causes the test case to fail when a non-Comparable object is added. The fix is to add a type check before executing the addValue method. If the object is not of a Comparable type, then the method should throw an IllegalArgumentException.
