Intent: The purpose of this code is to calculate and return the time in milliseconds based on the saved fields of a date or time. It sorts the saved fields, checks if the first field is a month or day, and if so, it alters the base year for parsing. The code also handles exceptions that might occur during the process. 

The failed test case is intended to verify that the date parser correctly translates a string in the format "xxxx-MM-ww" into a LocalDate object. The test case specifically checks if the string "2011-01-01" is correctly parsed into the LocalDate 2011, 1, 3.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs because the date string "2011-01-01" is being incorrectly parsed. The problem could be in the parser or the date format. The test case expects the string to be parsed into the LocalDate 2011, 1, 3, but it might be getting parsed into a different date.

It is necessary to debug and check whether the parsing process is working correctly and the date format "xxxx-MM-ww" is recognized and handled properly. If the problem is in the date format, the fix would be to adjust the parser to correctly handle this format. If the parser is the issue, it should be corrected to parse the date string accurately. 

Additionally, one needs to ensure that the right Chronology is used (GJChronology.getInstanceUTC() in this case) and if "xxxx-MM-ww" is the correct pattern for the format of the date string.
