Intent: The intent of this function is to convert a string number into an appropriate Number object such as BigInteger, Long, Integer, Double, Float or BigDecimal. The function does this by examining the string number, identifying its format (hexadecimal, decimal, etc.), and then converting it into the appropriate Number object.

Fix strategy: The specific failed test case indicates that the function is not correctly handling certain hexadecimal string numbers. The problem lies within the logic used to determine whether a hexadecimal number should be converted into a Long, Integer, or BigInteger. The current logic uses the length of the string to decide the type of Number to create, which may not be accurate for hexadecimal numbers due to their base-16 nature. 

We need to modify the logic to correctly identify and handle hexadecimal numbers, taking into account their base-16 nature. The logic should correctly determine whether a hexadecimal number should be converted to an Integer, Long, or BigInteger based on the actual numeric value of the hexadecimal number, not just its string length.

Additionally, we should also add more test cases to ensure that the function correctly handles various edge cases for hexadecimal numbers.
