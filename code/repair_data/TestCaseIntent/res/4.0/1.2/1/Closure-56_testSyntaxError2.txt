Intent: The intent of the provided source code is to find and return a specific line from a given code string which is stored in the 'js' variable. It uses the 'lineNumber' argument to determine the line to be returned. If the line does not exist, it returns null. The code also memorizes the offset of the last found line to optimize the search for the next line.

The failed test case is designed to ensure that the code correctly identifies and returns error messages from malformed JavaScript code. In this case, the test is expecting an exception due to a syntax error (an extra closing bracket) in the JavaScript code, and it checks if the error message contains the erroneous line of code ("if (true) {}}\n").

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be related to the fact that the implementation of the getLine method does not correctly handle the case when there is no newline character after the last line of the code. When it cannot find the newline character after the last line, it incorrectly returns null, even if the line exists. Therefore, when the test case checks if the error message contains the erroneous line of code, it fails because the erroneous line was not returned by the getLine method.

The fix could involve modifying the getLine method to correctly handle the case when there is no newline character after the last line of the code. If the newline character cannot be found and the position has not yet reached the end of the file, the method should return the contents between the position and the end of the file. 

Here's a modification to the last part of the method:

```java
int indexOfNextNewLine = js.indexOf('\n', pos);
if (indexOfNextNewLine == -1) {
    if (pos < js.length()) {
        return js.substring(pos);
    } else {
        return null;
    }
} else {
    return js.substring(pos, indexOfNextNewLine);
}
```

This modification checks if the position has reached the end of the file before returning null. If it hasn't, it returns the contents from the position to the end of the file.
