Intent: The purpose of the source code is to extract a class name from a Node object if the parent Node is an expression call (ExprCall) and the function name matches a specific criterion. The function name is compared with the qualified name of the callee node. If they match, the class name is extracted from the next node (if it exists). 

The test cases are intended to test the 'require' function. The function 'assertRequire' checks if the 'require' method is correctly called with a string argument. 'assertNotRequire' checks the cases where the 'require' method should not be recognized as correctly called.

Fix strategy: The test case 'assertNotRequire("goog.require(foo)")' is failing, which implies that the function is incorrectly recognizing 'goog.require(foo)' as a valid call. This could be due to the method interpreting 'foo' as a string even when it's not enclosed in quotes.

The source code needs to be modified to correctly distinguish between string arguments and non-string arguments. An additional condition should be added to verify if the target is a string literal. This can be done by adding a check `target.isString()`. The code modification could look like this:

```
if (target != null && target.isString()) {
    className = target.getString();
}
``` 

This way, only valid string literals will be considered as class names.
