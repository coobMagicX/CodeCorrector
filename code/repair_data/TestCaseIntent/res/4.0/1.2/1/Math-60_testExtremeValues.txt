Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the cumulative probability of a given number using normal distribution. The function tries to return the probability of a number, but if it exceeds the maximum iterations, it checks if the number is beyond a certain range from the mean, and returns 0 or 1 accordingly, otherwise, it throws an exception. The failed test case is designed to test extreme values like Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY and Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY against the source code.

Fix strategy: The source code fails at the line where it is supposed to return 1 when the value is Double.MAX_VALUE. The issue might be due to the value exceeding the threshold set in the code, i.e., mean + 20 * standardDeviation. A possible fix would be to handle these specific cases where the input value is Double.MAX_VALUE or Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY and directly return 1 as the cumulative probability. Similarly, handle the case for Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY to return 0. Implement these changes and run the test again to ensure it passes.
