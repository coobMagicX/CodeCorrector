Intent: The purpose of the code is to solve a univariate function using the Brent algorithm. The function accepts an initial guess and an interval specified by 'min' and 'max' parameters. The function is expected to throw an IllegalArgumentException if the provided interval is invalid (i.e., 'min' is greater than 'max') or if the function does not bracket the root (i.e., the function value at 'min' and 'max' does not cross zero).

Fix Strategy: The failed test cases show that the function did not throw the expected IllegalArgumentException when the interval does not bracket the root of the function. This suggests that the function does not correctly handle the verification of the interval provided.

1. A fix strategy could be to implement the check for bracketing before proceeding with the Brent algorithm. 

2. The code should check if the function values at 'min' and 'max' have the same sign. If they do, it means that the interval does not bracket a root and should throw an IllegalArgumentException.

3. The check can be implemented by evaluating the function at 'min' and 'max', and then checking the sign of their product. If the product is positive, the interval does not bracket a root and an exception should be thrown.

4. This check should be added after the 'verifySequence(min, initial, max);' line in the 'solve' method.
