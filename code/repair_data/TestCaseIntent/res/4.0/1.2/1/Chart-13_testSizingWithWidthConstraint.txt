Intent: The source code is intended to arrange a set of blocks within a container according to given constraints. The blocks can be placed in the top, bottom, left, right, or center of the container. The constraints specify the width and height of the container and the arrangement of the blocks. 

The failed test cases are those where a block is added to the container, the container is arranged according to a specified constraint, and the resultant size of the container is checked against expected values. The specific line that fails is the one where the arrange method is called on the container. 

Fix strategy: The arrange method seems to be miscalculating the placement and size of blocks within the container. To fix this, we need to thoroughly examine the arrange method and understand the logic it uses to place blocks and calculate the container's size. Once the issue is identified, the code should be amended to accurately calculate the size and arrangement of blocks within the container. 

It may also be helpful to add more detailed error messages to the failing test cases to better understand exactly how they're failing. For example, instead of simply stating that the test has failed, the error message could specify whether the width, height, or placement of the blocks is calculated incorrectly. This will help pinpoint the issue within the arrange method more quickly. 

Lastly, consider adding additional test cases with different block arrangements and container sizes to ensure that the arrange method works correctly in all scenarios.
