Intent: The intent of the failing test case ("single line padded text 2") is to verify that the `renderWrappedText` method correctly wraps and indents text when provided with a specific width and tab stop for padding subsequent lines after a line break.

Repair strategy: The problem seems to be with how the padding is applied to each line after the first break. The current implementation does not correctly apply the specified padding for subsequent lines after the first wrapping point. A repair should involve revising how the `nextLineTabStop` value is used to generate and apply padding for each subsequent wrapped line. Ensure that the padding is consistently applied to all lines after the initial one and verify that the line wrapping considers the added padding in calculating the wrap point. This may involve adjusting the calculation in the `findWrapPos` function to accurately reflect the effective width when padding is added.
