Intent: The purpose of the test `testBinaryAsEmbeddedObject` is to verify that the method `writeEmbeddedObject` correctly handles binary data (in this case, Base64-encoded bytes) by embedding it into a JSON structure, and ensuring the output matches the expected JSON-formatted Base64 string.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `writeEmbeddedObject` in the source code unconditionally throws a `JsonGenerationException`, indicating lack of support for writing embedded objects. To pass the test, you need to modify the `writeEmbeddedObject` method to handle binary data types, specifically byte arrays, by properly encoding them as Base64 strings when written to the output JSON. This involves checking the type of the object passed to the method, and if it's a byte array, encoding it to Base64 and writing it to the JSON output, rather than throwing an exception.
