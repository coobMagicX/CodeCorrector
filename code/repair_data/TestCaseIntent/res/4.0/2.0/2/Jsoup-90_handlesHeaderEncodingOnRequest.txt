Intent: The intent of the test case `handlesHeaderEncodingOnRequest` is to validate whether the `HttpConnection.Request` class can correctly handle and encode headers containing non-ASCII characters, in this case "Ã©", which is a common representation of accented characters when misinterpreted as ISO-8859-1 or similar encodings.

Repair strategy: To address the failure in the test and ensure proper handling of non-ASCII characters in HTTP headers, the source code should be adjusted to handle character encoding conversions properly. This might involve ensuring that headers are being encoded as UTF-8 before being processed or sent in a request. Additionally, the `looksLikeUtf8` method should be reviewed to confirm its accuracy in detecting UTF-8 encoded data, especially since the existing logic may not correctly handle all valid UTF-8 sequences. The implementation should be checked to ensure it aligns with the UTF-8 encoding standard, particularly in multi-byte character scenarios. Also, verify and correct the bit-wise AND operation in the BOM (Byte Order Mark) detection logic (`(input[1] & 0xFF) == 0xBB & (input[2] & 0xFF) == 0xBF` should be `(input[1] & 0xFF) == 0xBB && (input[2] & 0xFF) == 0xBF`).
