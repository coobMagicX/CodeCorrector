Intent: The intent of the test case `testSingleOptionSingleArgument` is to ensure that the method `getValues` correctly retrieves a list of values for a given option from the command line input, and if the retrieved list is empty or null, it should then default to a predefined set of values. The expected behavior in this test is that the method should return both the user-entered value and the default value associated with the option.

Repair strategy: The code currently replaces `valueList` with `defaultValues` or `this.defaultValues.get(option)` if `valueList` is null or empty, but it does not combine user-entered values with additional default values. To fix this, the source code should be modified to merge the user-entered values with the default values when the user-provided list isn't null but might still need augmentation with additional default values. This can be done by checking the existence and the content of `valueList` after retrieving user inputs and then appending the missing default values as necessary. The merging process should ensure that it does not introduce duplicates unless explicitly allowed.
