Intent: The test case is designed to verify the behavior of the `ZipArchiveInputStream` class when attempting to read from a truncated multi-volume ZIP archive. The test ensures that the class correctly identifies and handles the error condition by raising an appropriate exception when it encounters a truncated entry, and that it does not allow reading beyond the truncated content.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to detect when an archive entry is truncated or corrupted, particularly when the actual data size does not match the expected size, and throw an appropriate exception. Additionally, the source code should handle scenarios where subsequent entries are accessed after a truncated entry, ensuring that proper error handling is maintained. This could involve updating the logic that checks the integrity of each zip entry and verifying the actual bytes read against the expected size, possibly using checksum or similar mechanisms. The repair should include proper handling of end-of-archive conditions to prevent infinite loops or incorrect reads after a truncated entry is detected.
