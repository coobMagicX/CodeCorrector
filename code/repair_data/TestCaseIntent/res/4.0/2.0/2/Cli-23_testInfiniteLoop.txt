Intent: The purpose of the test case `testInfiniteLoop` is to ensure that the method `renderWrappedText` can handle processing of text that does not naturally fit within the specified width without entering into an infinite loop.

Repair strategy: The issue likely arises from the way `pos` is recalculated within the loop. To prevent an infinite loop, adjust the logic that recalculates `pos` to ensure it progressively moves forward in the string, which may involve revising the `findWrapPos` method or the way `text` is manipulated within the loop after each iteration. Ensure that `pos` changes in each iteration to prevent the loop from executing with the same value of `pos`, which currently triggers the exception and could potentially cause an infinite loop.
