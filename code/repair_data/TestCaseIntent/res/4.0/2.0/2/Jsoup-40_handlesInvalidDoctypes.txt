Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the parser (Jsoup) can correctly handle malformed DOCTYPE declarations in HTML documents. These test cases aim to ensure that the parser gracefully handles cases where the DOCTYPE is empty, contains invalid characters, or is not followed by proper structure, without throwing exceptions or errors.

Repair strategy: Modify the parsing logic within Jsoup to better handle edge cases or erroneous input related to DOCTYPE declarations. This includes:
1. Implementing a more robust validation or normalization process when parsing DOCTYPE strings to ensure that empty or malformed DOCTYPEs do not result in exceptions.
2. Adding additional checks or fallback mechanisms for when DOCTYPE attributes (name, publicId, systemId) are missing or contain invalid characters, ensuring that the parser still constructs a valid HTML document structure.
3. Enhancing error handling to capture and manage unusual or unexpected character entries (like null characters) within the DOCTYPE declaration.
