Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to evaluate XPath expressions where the nodes do not exist in the XML context or are empty, and ensure that relational operations with a non-existent node set correctly return `Boolean.FALSE` for various comparison operators.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to properly handle cases where the result of `args[0].computeValue(context)` or `args[1].computeValue(context)` yields a node set that is empty or non-existent. The current code likely does not account for the special nature of comparing non-existent or empty node sets, which should not satisfy any relational operation against numbers. Modify the `compute` method to check if either argument is an empty or non-existent node set and return `Boolean.FALSE` accordingly. This adjustment will ensure that operations involving non-existent nodes are correctly interpreted as false, aligning with the failed test case expectations.
