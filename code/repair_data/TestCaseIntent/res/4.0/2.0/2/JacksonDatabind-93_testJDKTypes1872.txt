Intent: The intent of the test case `testJDKTypes1872` is to ensure that the `ObjectMapper` with enabled default typing can successfully deserialize JSON data into an instance of the `Authentication1872` class without being blocked by the security checks implemented in the `validateSubType` method.

Repair strategy: The repair direction involves examining the security checks within the `validateSubType` method to ensure that legitimate classes like `Authentication1872` are not inadvertently blocked. This may include refining the conditions under which classes are considered illegal or adjusting the criteria used to identify potentially dangerous classes. Additionally, the list `_cfgIllegalClassNames` and the conditions checking for class names starting with `PREFIX_STRING` should be reviewed and potentially updated to correctly handle and differentiate between safe and unsafe types during deserialization.
