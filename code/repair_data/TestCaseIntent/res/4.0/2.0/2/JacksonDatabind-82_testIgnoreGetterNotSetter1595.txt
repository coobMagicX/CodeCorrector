Intent: The test case `testIgnoreGetterNotSetter1595` is intended to verify that the serialization process correctly ignores the getter for the `name` property (thus not including it in the serialized JSON) but still respects the setter during deserialization, allowing the property to be set from the JSON input.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the source code correctly differentiates between ignoring properties for serialization and deserialization. Specifically, the part of the source code handling the application of `@JsonIgnore` or similar configurations should be verified to ensure that it only affects serialization when intended, and does not inadvertently prevent properties from being set during deserialization. Adjust the handling of ignored properties within the `addBeanProps` method, possibly by refining how properties are filtered and added to the builder, ensuring that setter methods are recognized and utilized even if their corresponding getters are ignored for serialization purposes.
