Intent: The test case `testReadProperties` is intended to validate that the `MAPPER` can correctly read a JSON string into a `Properties` object, ensuring that both string and non-string values (like integers and booleans) are correctly converted to strings and stored in the `Properties` object. The test checks if the size of the `Properties` object is correct and if the values are correctly retrieved and matched against expected string representations.

Repair strategy: The issue seems to be with the handling of non-string JSON values (in this case, an integer) when converting them into the string values expected by the `Properties` object. The test fails at the line which asserts that the integer value `123` has been converted to the string `"123"`. The source code needs a modification either in the `MAPPER.readValue` method or in the `_mapType` logic to ensure that all values, regardless of their original JSON type, are converted to string representations in the resulting `Properties` object. The repair should focus on ensuring that the type conversion or serialization logic handles all types consistently as strings when populating the `Properties` object.
