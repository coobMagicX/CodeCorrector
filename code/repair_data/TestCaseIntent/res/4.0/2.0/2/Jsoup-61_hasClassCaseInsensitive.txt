Intent: The test case `hasClassCaseInsensitive` is intended to verify that the `hasClass` method correctly identifies class names in a case-insensitive manner. It validates that regardless of how the class attribute's case is presented in the HTML (mixed, upper, lower), the method should return true if the class name matches, ignoring case differences.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `attributes.get("class")` method call successfully retrieves the class attribute in a case-insensitive manner. The current failure suggests that the method might be case-sensitive or improperly handling the retrieval of class attributes with varied casing ("Class", "class", "CLASS"). The repair should involve adjusting the attribute retrieval logic to normalize the case, or ensure case-insensitivity is maintained throughout the attribute checking process. This could involve modifying how attributes are stored or fetched, ensuring case insensitivity at the point of retrieval or during the comparison.
