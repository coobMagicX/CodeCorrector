Intent: The test case `testByteToStringVariations` is designed to verify the correct encoding of byte arrays to Base64 strings using different inputs, including non-empty strings, empty arrays, null input, and hexadecimal decoded data. The test checks both the custom Base64 instance and the static methods of the Base64 class to ensure consistent behavior across different methods and input scenarios.

Repair strategy: The failed test case suggests that the static method `Base64.encodeBase64String` may not be handling inputs as expected when compared to the instance method `base64.encodeToString`. Specifically, the failure in encoding a simple string ("Hello World") to its Base64 representation indicates a potential inconsistency or error in how the static method processes the byte array input. The repair should focus on ensuring that the static method `encodeBase64String` uses the correct Base64 encoding settings (possibly regarding line breaks or URL-safety settings) and behaves consistently with the non-static `encodeToString` method. This might involve reviewing and adjusting how the `encodeBase64` method is called or its parameters configured in the static context.
