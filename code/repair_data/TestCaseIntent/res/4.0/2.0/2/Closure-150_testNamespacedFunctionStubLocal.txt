Intent: The test case `testNamespacedFunctionStubLocal` is intended to verify that a namespaced function stub (`goog.foo`) is correctly recognized and handled within a local function scope. This includes checking that the property `foo` exists on the object `goog`, ensuring the property type is correctly declared and matches the expected function signature, and verifying that the scope's variable type for `goog.foo` is consistent with the declared property type.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that properties added to namespace objects within local scopes are correctly registered and their types are accurately maintained. The repair should focus on the logic that handles variable definitions and property assignments within nested scopes or namespaces. It might be necessary to adjust the `defineVar` or a similar function to better handle namespace property assignments, ensuring that properties like `goog.foo` are treated as valid entries in their respective scopes and have their types mapped correctly.
