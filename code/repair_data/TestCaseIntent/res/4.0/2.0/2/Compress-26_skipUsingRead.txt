Intent: The intent of the failing test case 'skipUsingRead()' is to validate the behavior of the `skip` method when it encounters an `InputStream` that always returns 0 when the `skip` method is called. The purpose is to ensure that the method correctly handles situations where `skip` is ineffective, potentially by reading the bytes to skip if the `skip` does not advance the stream.

Repair strategy: Modify the `skip` method to add a fallback mechanism where if the `skip` method on the `InputStream` returns 0, the method should manually read and discard bytes up to the number specified by `numToSkip`. This fallback should only activate if the `skip` method does not progress (i.e., returns 0 repeatedly) to ensure that the method can handle streams that do not support skipping properly.
