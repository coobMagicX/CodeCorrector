Intent: The test case `testNestedUnwrappedLists180` aims to verify that the XML parsing and deserialization into Java objects correctly handles nested, potentially empty XML elements representing collections. It specifically tests that empty XML collection elements do not cause null entries in the resulting Java collections, and that non-empty nested collections are parsed correctly with their respective elements.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the XML to JSON token parsing logic to accurately handle cases where XML elements intended to represent empty collections do not result in null values in the deserialized Java objects. This might involve adjusting how empty XML text or elements are interpreted and ensuring that they correctly translate to empty collections or objects rather than nulls. Additionally, the code should reliably parse nested structures and manage context transitions (e.g., from `START_OBJECT` to `END_OBJECT`) without losing information about the containment hierarchy. This might require refining the conditions under which tokens are generated or consumed, particularly in the handling of `XML_TEXT` and empty elements within array contexts.
