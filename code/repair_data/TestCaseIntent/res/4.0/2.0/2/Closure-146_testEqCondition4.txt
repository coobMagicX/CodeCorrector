Intent: The purpose of the test `testEqCondition4` is to verify the behavior of the `testBinop` method when comparing two variables of `VOID_TYPE` using the equality operator (`Token.EQ`). The expected outcome is that both variables continue to have the same type before and after the operation, or possibly that they are both resolved to `NO_TYPE` based on specific implementation details.

Repair strategy: The failing test case suggests that there might be an issue in handling `VOID_TYPE` or similar types within the `getTypesUnderInequality` or related methods. To address this, review and adjust the handling of `VOID_TYPE` and other special types in both `getTypesUnderInequality` and `testForEquality` methods. Ensure that equality tests involving special types like `VOID_TYPE` are handled correctly, potentially by returning specific type pairs or modifying the type resolution logic to correctly reflect the expected behavior when such types are compared using equality operators.
