Intent: The test case `handlesControlCodeInAttributeName` is designed to ensure that the parser correctly handles and possibly sanitizes attribute names that contain control characters. The intention is to verify that the system gracefully degrades by either ignoring or correctly processing HTML elements with attributes that include non-standard characters, particularly control codes, which should not typically appear in attribute names.

Repair strategy: Modify the parser to either remove or handle control characters in attribute names properly. This can be achieved by enhancing the attribute name sanitization process to check for and exclude or escape control characters. The `trim()` method used in the source code may not handle non-whitespace control characters, so a more robust method for cleaning attribute names needs to be implemented. This could involve using a regular expression to strip out non-valid characters or implementing a more explicit check before adding attributes to the `attributes` object. Implementing these changes will help ensure that the parser maintains HTML standards compliance and robustness against malformed input.
