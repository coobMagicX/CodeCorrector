Intent: The test case `testCodec112` aims to verify that the `encodeBase64` function calculates the encoded size correctly depending on whether the output is chunked or not. The test checks that when encoding is not chunked, the size of the output array should not exceed the input array's length.

Repair strategy: Modify the `encodeBase64` method to accurately calculate the expected length of the encoded array depending on the chunking parameter. Ensure that the `getEncodeLength` method differentiates between chunked and non-chunked encoding scenarios accurately, adjusting the output size calculation accordingly. This involves revising the logic in the `getEncodeLength` method to handle both chunked and non-chunked scenarios correctly, potentially adding a condition to check the `isChunked` parameter.
