Intent: The test case `testWonkyNumber173` is designed to validate that the JsonPointer does not incorrectly interpret strings with scientific notation (e.g., "1e0") as valid array indices. The intent is to ensure that the JsonPointer correctly identifies and handles non-numeric characters in what should be an index for an array, preventing misinterpretations and potential crashes or unexpected behaviors.

Repair strategy: Modify the `_parseIndex` method to properly handle cases where the index string contains characters that might be legal in numeric representations (like 'e' in "1e0") but are not actual digits. The method should consistently check each character to ensure it's a digit from '0' to '9' and not increment the index `i` prematurely within the loop. The current increment in the loop `char c = str.charAt(i++);` should be corrected to `char c = str.charAt(i);` to properly check each character individually. Additionally, consider implementing a check specifically for scientific notation and ensure such strings are immediately deemed invalid for indices.
