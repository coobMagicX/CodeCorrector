Intent: The test case `testClonesClassnames` is intended to verify that the `clone` method of the `Element` class properly copies the set of class names from the original element without linking the class names set in the original and cloned object. This means that changes to the class names in the cloned object should not affect the class names in the original object.

Repair strategy: Modify the `clone` method in the `Element` class to ensure that it creates a deep copy of the `classNames` set. This involves not only cloning the `Element` object itself but also explicitly cloning any mutable fields, like `Set<String> classNames`, to ensure that the original and the cloned object do not share the same instance of `classNames`. This can be achieved by initializing a new `Set` for `classNames` in the cloned object and copying the contents from the original to the new set.
