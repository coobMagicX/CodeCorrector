Intent: The `testReadWinZipArchive` test case is designed to validate that the application can correctly read and process entries from a zip file created with WinZip, specifically ensuring that files with various character encodings in their names (like EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT) can be accessed without errors.

Repair strategy: Given the failure on `assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT)`, the issue likely lies in the handling of file names with special or non-ASCII characters. The problem might be in the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` function where file names are read and processed. Ensure proper encoding handling (possibly UTF-8) when reading the file names from the zip archive. This could involve setting the appropriate flags or ensuring that the `ZipArchiveEntry` objects are correctly handling UTF-8 encoded names, especially in the context of entries listed in `entriesWithoutUTF8Flag`. Revisit and possibly adjust how `setNameAndCommentFromExtraFields` interprets and sets file names with respect to encoding.
