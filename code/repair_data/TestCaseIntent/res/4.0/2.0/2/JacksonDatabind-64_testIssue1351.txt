Intent: The test case `testIssue1351` is intended to serialize two different types of objects (Issue1351Bean and Issue1351NonBean) using Jacksonâ€™s ObjectMapper with the NON_DEFAULT inclusion strategy. The expected behavior is that the serialization omits default or null values from the JSON output, resulting in an empty JSON object (`{}`) for both instances.

Repair strategy: Investigate and modify the implementation of the `NON_DEFAULT` inclusion logic within the `buildWriter` method of the source code to ensure that it correctly identifies and suppresses properties that have default or null values. This will likely involve reviewing how default values are determined and handled for different types, particularly focusing on any discrepancies in handling primitive types, reference types, and their corresponding wrapper classes. Additionally, ensure that the logic for determining "default" values aligns accurately with what is considered default in the test scenario.
