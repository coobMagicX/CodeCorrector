Intent: The intent of the test case `testSkipValue_filledJsonObject` is to validate that the `skipValue` method correctly skips the entire JSON object structure when called, leading to the end of the document being the next token to be read.

Repair strategy: The current `skipValue` method implementation seems to incorrectly handle the stack manipulations and path updates when skipping nested structures like arrays or objects within objects. The repair should focus on ensuring that `skipValue` comprehensively and accurately skips over all nested elements without leaving any residual state that would prevent `peek()` from returning `JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT` after skipping. This might involve more robust handling of the stack and path arrays, possibly clearing or correctly decrementing stack sizes and properly managing indices and names to reflect the new state after a complete skip.
