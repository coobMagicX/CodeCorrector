Intent:
The intent of the test case `constructorValidationOkWithBlankName` is to check if the `DocumentType` constructor correctly handles cases where all parameters (name, publicId, systemId, baseUri) are provided as empty strings.

Repair strategy:
Revise the code to handle cases where `name` can be an empty string without throwing an exception, as the test case expects the constructor to accept empty strings without errors. This might involve modifying or removing the validation check `Validate.notEmpty(name)` if the system's design allows a `DocumentType` with an empty name, or adjusting the test case if such a condition should actually not be permitted.
