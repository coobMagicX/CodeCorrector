Intent:
The intent of the test case `attributeWithBrackets` is to ensure that HTML elements with data attributes containing special characters such as brackets can be correctly parsed and accessed using a selector query. The test verifies that the method can handle data attributes with closing square brackets and other special characters accurately, returning the correct text content from the elements.

Repair strategy:
The source code should be reviewed and modified to ensure that the parsing and handling of attribute values in HTML elements are robust against special characters, particularly brackets that could be interpreted in a way that disrupts the parsing logic. This will involve enhancing the string parsing logic in the method or the library used to parse and query HTML to correctly interpret data attributes with special characters without misinterpreting them as part of the HTML syntax or ending the attribute value prematurely.
