Intent: The intent of the test case `testMapValueEquality` is to validate the equality and inequality of values stored in a map using XPath expressions. The test checks if different keys ('a', 'b', 'c') in a map hold values that are correctly evaluated as equal or not equal to each other.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the implementation correctly interprets and compares the values associated with different keys in the map. This might involve reviewing the XPath expression handling and evaluation within the context, or ensuring that the map's data handling (insertion, retrieval) maintains the integrity and distinctness of values as expected. If `getBaseValue()` or `ValueUtils.getLength()` is involved in defining map values, verify their correctness and consistency in returning values. Ensure that no unintended references or value overwrites occur when populating the map.
