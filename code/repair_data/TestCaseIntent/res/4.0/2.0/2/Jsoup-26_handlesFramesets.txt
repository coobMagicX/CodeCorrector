Intent: The test case "handlesFramesets" is designed to ensure that the `clean` method correctly removes elements that are not allowed according to a specified whitelist (such as framesets and scripts), and returns an empty or appropriately sanitized document.

Repair strategy: Investigate and modify the `clean` method to ensure that it correctly processes and filters out HTML elements like `<frameset>` and `<frame>` which are not typically allowed in a basic whitelist. This might involve adjusting the `copySafeNodes` method to check against the whitelist more effectively or to ensure that nodes considered unsafe or not compliant with the whitelist are not copied into the cleaned document. Additionally, ensure that the method handles different types of nodes (like framesets) which might not be part of the typical body node structure in HTML documents.
