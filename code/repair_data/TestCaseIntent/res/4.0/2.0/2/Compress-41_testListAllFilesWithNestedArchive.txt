Intent: The intent of the test case `testListAllFilesWithNestedArchive` is to ensure that the method `getNextEntry` correctly handles and lists all files within a zip archive, including files within any nested zip archives. The test also checks for the proper handling of exceptions when attempting to read nested entries that are not valid archives.

Repair strategy: The test case expects exactly one `ZipException` to be thrown, which indicates an issue with handling nested zip files or entries that are not zip archives. The source code should include a mechanism to ensure that it only attempts to create a nested `ArchiveInputStream` for valid zip files, and properly handle or report errors for invalid nested entries. Additionally, the method should be checked to ensure that it accurately identifies and skips over non-archive entries when attempting to process nested archives, preventing unintended exceptions. Adjustments should also be made to properly count and handle expected exceptions, ensuring the test condition `assertEquals(1, expectedExceptions.size())` is met under expected circumstances. This might involve refining how exceptions are caught and added to the `expectedExceptions` list within the nested loop.
