Intent: The purpose of the test case `testUnrecognizedOption2` is to validate that the parser correctly identifies and throws an exception for unrecognized command-line options. The test specifically checks for an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when the parser encounters the option `-z`, which is assumed to be unrecognized based on the test setup.

Repair strategy: The `processOptionToken` method should be modified to throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when an unrecognized option is encountered and `stopAtNonOption` is false. Currently, the method only adds the unrecognized token to `tokens` and sets `eatTheRest` to true if `stopAtNonOption` is true. There should be a clear mechanism to handle the case when an unrecognized option is found and `stopAtNonOption` is false, potentially by throwing the appropriate exception. This will ensure that the parser behaves as expected by the test case and properly signals an error when encountering an unknown option.
