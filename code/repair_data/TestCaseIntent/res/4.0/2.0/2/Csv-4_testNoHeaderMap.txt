Intent:
The intent of the test case `testNoHeaderMap` is to verify that the method `getHeaderMap()` of the `CSVParser` class returns `null` when no header map is explicitly defined or inferred from the input CSV data. This is typically expected when the CSV data does not contain headers or the parser is not configured to treat the first line as headers.

Repair strategy:
The `getHeaderMap()` method currently returns a new `LinkedHashMap` derived from an instance variable `headerMap`, which seems to be initialized by default, hence never returning `null`. To align the actual behavior with the expected result of the test:
1. Modify the `getHeaderMap()` method to return `null` if the `headerMap` is empty or not initialized.
2. Ensure that the parser's configuration (handled elsewhere in the code, likely in the constructor or a setup method) correctly identifies when headers should be extracted from the input data and initializes `headerMap` accordingly.
3. Adjust the initialization of `headerMap` such that it remains `null` when no headers are present or intended to be used, instead of defaulting to an empty `LinkedHashMap`.
