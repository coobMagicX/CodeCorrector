Intent: The purpose of the test case `testExactOptionNameMatch` is to verify that the `DefaultParser` can correctly parse and recognize an exact option name (i.e., `--prefix`) from a set of command-line arguments, ensuring that the application accurately handles full option names without any errors.

Repair strategy: The test failure indicates a potential issue in how options are being parsed or matched in the `getMatchingOptions` method or in the `DefaultParser`'s parsing logic. 
1. Ensure that `getMatchingOptions` is correctly identifying and returning exact matches. If `getMatchingOptions` is intended to only return options that start with the given input but not necessarily exact matches, this behavior might need to be adjusted or clarified.
2. Verify the integration between `getMatchingOptions` and `DefaultParser` to ensure that exact matches are correctly handled in the parsing process.
3. Check if `getOptions()` within the test setup correctly includes `--prefix` in its list of options.
4. Consider adding a condition in `getMatchingOptions` to differentiate between starting match and exact match, ensuring that exact matches are prioritized or handled distinctly if necessary.
