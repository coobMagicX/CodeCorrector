Intent: The test case `testThrowOnInvalidEntry` is designed to verify that the `getNextZipEntry()` method properly throws an exception when it encounters an invalid entry in a ZIP file. Specifically, it expects an `IOException` or a similar error that indicates an issue with the ZIP file format, like an unexpected record signature.

Repair strategy: Update the `getNextZipEntry()` method in the source code to explicitly check for invalid or unexpected signatures and throw an appropriate exception (such as `ZipException`) when an invalid signature is detected. This can be handled where signatures are read and compared, ensuring that any non-conforming ZIP format leads to an immediate and informative exception. Adjust exception handling to align with the types of exceptions the test anticipates (e.g., from `IOException` to `ZipException` with a descriptive message).
