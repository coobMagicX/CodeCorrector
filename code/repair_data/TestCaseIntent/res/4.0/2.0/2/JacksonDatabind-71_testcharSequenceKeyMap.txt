Intent: The intent of the test case `testcharSequenceKeyMap` is to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<CharSequence, String>` and verify that the map is correctly populated with the expected values.

Repair strategy: The source code in the method `forType(Class<?> raw)` does not handle the case when `raw` is an instance of `CharSequence`. This omission likely causes the deserialization process to fail or behave unexpectedly when dealing with `Map<CharSequence, String>`. To fix this, the method should include a check for `CharSequence.class` and handle it appropriately, similar to how `String.class` and `Object.class` are treated, given that `String` implements `CharSequence`. This could involve returning a suitable `StdKeyDeserializer` that can handle `CharSequence` keys in a map.
