Intent: The test case `testEscapedMySqlNullValue` aims to validate the lexer's ability to correctly handle and return the MySQL-specific escaped sequence `\N` which represents a null value, ensuring that the lexer does not mistakenly process or alter this sequence.

Repair strategy: The source code in `readEscape()` does not currently handle the case for `\N`. To pass this test case, the method should be updated to correctly recognize and return the sequence `\N` when encountered. This can be done by adding a new case in the switch statement that checks if the character following the backslash is 'N', and if so, returns a specific constant or representation that the rest of the lexer correctly interprets as a MySQL null value. This addition will ensure that the sequence `\N` is preserved as intended when processed by the lexer.
