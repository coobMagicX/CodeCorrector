Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that when a checkbox input element in a form is checked but no explicit value attribute is provided, the default value used should be "on". This is a common behavior in HTML forms where the absence of a value attribute for a checked checkbox defaults to "on".

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to check if the checkbox or radio input type does not have a value attribute set and if so, use a default value of "on". Currently, the code retrieves whatever value is associated with the checkbox or radio input, which defaults to an empty string if not explicitly set. The code needs to be adjusted to handle this case by explicitly checking for an empty or null value and setting it to "on" if the input type is "checkbox" or "radio" and it is marked as checked. This can be achieved by adding an appropriate condition within the existing if block for handling checkbox and radio inputs.
