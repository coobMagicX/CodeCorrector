Intent: The purpose of this test case is to validate that the type specified with `@this` in a function declaration correctly resolves to an object type, even when it refers to a typedef that is declared afterwards in the source. The intent is to ensure that typedefs are resolved correctly and that their usage in annotations like `@this` adhere to expected type constraints (i.e., must be an object).

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to enhance the handling of typedef resolutions, especially when they are used in type annotations that have specific type requirements such as `@this`. Ensure that typedefs are either eagerly resolved or correctly re-checked once their actual type definitions are encountered later in the code. This could involve implementing a two-pass resolution system where typedefs are first collected and then resolved, or enhancing the `safeResolve` method to handle delayed or forward references in typedefs more gracefully.
