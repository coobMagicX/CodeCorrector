Intent: The intent of the test case `testMissingOptionsException` is to ensure that the `checkRequiredOptions` method properly identifies when required options "f" and "x" are not provided in the command line arguments, and throws a `MissingOptionException` with a precise message indicating the specific missing required options.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the `checkRequiredOptions` method to include a more descriptive message in the `MissingOptionException`. Specifically, the method should format the output string to clearly state which options are missing, potentially prefixing it with "Missing required options: " and ensuring options are listed in a consistent order (e.g., alphabetically) if order is not guaranteed by the current implementation. Adjust the string construction in `checkRequiredOptions` to reflect this format and consider the order of elements when appending to the `StringBuffer`.
