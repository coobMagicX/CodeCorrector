Intent: The test `testExcessDataInZip64ExtraField()` is intended to validate that the ZipFile instance can correctly parse the central directory data of a zip file, specifically in relation to the Zip64 extended information extra field. It checks if the size of the entry is correctly reported by the ZipFile class after parsing an archive that potentially contains excess data in the Zip64 extra field.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the `reparseCentralDirectoryData` method correctly handles scenarios where there might be excess data beyond the expected fields in the Zip64 extra field. This includes verifying that the method does not strictly enforce the length to be exactly equal to the sum of specified fields but rather checks that it is at least the minimum required length. Modify the method to allow some flexibility in handling extra data that does not correspond to the expected Zip64 fields without throwing an exception.
