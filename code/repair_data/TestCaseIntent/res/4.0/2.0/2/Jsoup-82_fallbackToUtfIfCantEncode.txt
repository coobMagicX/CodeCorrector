Intent: The test case "fallbackToUtfIfCantEncode" is intended to verify that when the input HTML specifies a charset (ISO-2022-CN) that cannot be encoded, the parser should automatically fallback to using UTF-8 as the document's charset. The test also checks that the output HTML correctly reflects this charset change and preserves the content.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a mechanism to detect if the specified charset in the HTML content can be encoded or not. If the charset cannot be encoded, the parser should automatically switch to UTF-8. This might involve adding a check after determining the charset (either from BOM, meta tags, or XML declaration) to see if it is encodable and, if not, setting the charset to UTF-8. This logic seems to be missing or not functioning correctly in the current implementation. Additionally, ensure that the output settings of the document are updated to reflect this charset change before the document is outputted.
