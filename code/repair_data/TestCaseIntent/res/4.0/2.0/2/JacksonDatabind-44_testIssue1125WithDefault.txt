Intent: The test case `testIssue1125WithDefault` is intended to deserialize a JSON string into an `Issue1125Wrapper` object, asserting that the nested object `value` is of type `Default1125` and the fields `a`, `b`, and `def` are correctly populated according to the provided JSON values.

Repair strategy: The source code likely fails the test case due to improper handling of subtype relationships during deserialization. The `_narrow` method is involved in type adjustments but currently lacks checks to ensure the subclass relationship, which could lead to incorrect type instantiation. To fix this issue:
1. Implement a check in the `_narrow` method to validate that `subclass` is indeed a subclass of `_class`.
2. If `subclass` is not a valid subclass, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
3. Ensure that the deserialization process respects type hierarchies and correctly instantiates objects according to their defined types in the JSON structure. This might involve adjusting the `MAPPER` configuration to correctly handle polymorphic deserialization or ensuring that type information is accurately passed and processed during deserialization.
