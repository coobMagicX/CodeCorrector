Intent: The test case `testCustomEnumValueAndKeyViaModifier` is intended to verify the functionality of custom enumeration key deserialization using a deserializer modifier. This involves ensuring that keys, even when represented in different case formats in JSON, are correctly mapped to the corresponding enum values in Java, specifically testing with `EnumMap`.

Repair strategy: The possible issue seems to lie in the handling of case sensitivity during key deserialization. The test fails because the custom key deserializer defined in `modifyKeyDeserializer` likely does not handle case insensitivity as required by the test scenario. The JSON input uses 'REPlaceMENTS' which needs to be recognized as 'REPLACEMENTS'. Therefore, the repair should focus on ensuring that the custom `KeyDeserializer` in `modifyKeyDeserializer` correctly handles different cases (upper, lower, mixed) seamlessly. This might involve modifying the `deserializeKey` method to standardize input keys to a specific case (e.g., all upper or all lower) before matching them to the enum constants. This would ensure that keys are correctly identified regardless of their case in the JSON data.
