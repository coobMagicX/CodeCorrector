Intent:
The purpose of the test cases is to verify the behavior of the `processProperties` method when handling different property values and to ensure that the command line options are correctly parsed and added based on these properties. The test cases aim to check:
1. Boolean-like values ("true", "yes", "1") are correctly interpreted to enable options.
2. Non-boolean values ("false", "no", "0", "just a string", "") either disable or appropriately handle options depending on their designed behavior in the command-line options.

Repair strategy:
1. Examine and potentially modify the logic in the `processProperties` method that checks for the presence of arguments (`opt.hasArg()`) and how values are processed. There might be an error in the way boolean and non-boolean values are treated, particularly for options that accept arguments (`e` in the failing test case).
2. Ensure that the `processProperties` method correctly interprets "true", "yes", "1" to add options and handles all other cases according to the specific requirements of the option (whether it should accept any string, no string, or specific boolean-like strings).
3. Review and correct the loop's flow control, specifically the `break` statement under the `else if` condition, which might be prematurely terminating the processing of options. This could be why some options are not being added as expected when non-boolean values are encountered. Consider changing `break` to `continue` to allow the loop to process subsequent property names.
4. Implement additional checks for null or empty values when an option is designed to accept an argument, ensuring that such cases are handled gracefully and in line with the expected behavior outlined in the test cases.
