Intent: The test case `testLocalType728` is designed to verify that the method `constructType` correctly interprets and constructs JavaType instances from both the return type and parameter types of a method, handling type erasure and generic types accurately. This ensures that the type information is preserved correctly through the construction process, especially in scenarios involving generics.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed to ensure correct handling of generics when constructing JavaType instances from method return types and parameter types. The error suggests a potential mismatch or incorrect type resolution when handling generic types. The method `_fromVariable` in conjunction with `constructType` may need enhancement to better handle scenarios where generics are involved, specifically ensuring that the context (`TypeBindings`) correctly resolves generic types and does not default to the erased type or an incorrect interpretation. Debugging should focus on how `context.findType(name)` resolves the variable `name` and whether it correctly accounts for generic types as specified in the method signatures. Additionally, handling of bounds in `_fromVariable` should be examined to ensure that it correctly uses the first bound type when multiple bounds are present or when dealing with recursive type definitions.
