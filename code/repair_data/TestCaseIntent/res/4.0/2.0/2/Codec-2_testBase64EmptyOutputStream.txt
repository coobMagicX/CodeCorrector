Intent: The test case `testBase64EmptyOutputStream` is intended to verify that the Base64 encoding process correctly handles an empty input array, producing an empty output array without throwing any exceptions or errors, regardless of the line length or line separator configuration.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `encode` method correctly handles cases where `inAvail` is 0, which indicates that there are no bytes to encode. This might involve checking if the method properly returns or bypasses encoding logic when `inAvail` is 0, preventing unnecessary resizing of buffers or adjustments to modulus calculations. Additionally, verify that the method does not add line separators when there are no encoded bytes. Adjust the logic that handles input availability to properly manage the edge cases of empty data input.
