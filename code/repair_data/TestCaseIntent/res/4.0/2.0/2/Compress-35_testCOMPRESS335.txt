Intent: The test case `testCOMPRESS335` is intended to verify that the method `getStreamFor` correctly opens and returns a `TarArchiveInputStream` when provided with a TAR file named "COMPRESS-335.tar". This is to ensure that the system can handle TAR archives properly, specifically focusing on the ability to read and process the tar archive format.

Repair strategy: Analyze and ensure that the `getStreamFor` method is correctly implemented to handle the opening of TAR files and returning the appropriate type of `InputStream`, particularly `TarArchiveInputStream`. If the method does not handle file opening or type casting correctly, these areas should be the focus of the repair. Additionally, make sure the file "COMPRESS-335.tar" is correctly placed in the accessible resources directory and is not corrupted, as these could also be reasons for the test failure.
