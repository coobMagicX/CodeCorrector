Intent:
The intent of the test case `testCustomMapValueDeser735` is to verify that deserialization for a JSON object into a Java object (`TestMapBean735`) correctly applies custom deserializers to certain map fields within the object, while using default deserialization behavior for others. Specifically, it tests that `map1` uses a custom deserializer that transforms the value of "a" from 1 to 100, and `map2` uses the default deserialization behavior.

Repair strategy:
The repair direction should focus on ensuring that the deserialization process correctly identifies and applies custom deserializers where specified, and default deserializers otherwise. This might involve checking the implementation of how deserializers are associated with specific properties or map fields within the `TestMapBean735` class. Additionally, ensure that the method `isCachable` properly handles the caching logic to not cache deserializers when custom deserializers are used, which might interfere with applying the correct deserialization logic. This could be done by revisiting the conditions under which caching is prevented or allowed, ensuring that custom deserializers are not being inadvertently cached, leading to incorrect or unexpected deserialization outcomes.
