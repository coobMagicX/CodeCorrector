Intent: The test case `testProperties` is intended to verify that the `TypeFactory` correctly constructs a `MapType` for the `Properties` class, ensuring both the type of the map and the type parameters (key and content types) are correctly identified as `String`.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to handle the special case of `Properties` class by ensuring that when `Properties` is passed as the `rawClass`, the `typeParams` are explicitly set to `String.class` for both key and content types, regardless of what `findTypeParameters` returns. This is because the `Properties` class, which essentially represents a persistent set of properties in key-value pair form (where both keys and values are `String`), does not use generic type parameters in its declaration. Therefore, the method `_mapType` should include a check to see if the `rawClass` is `Properties` and manually assign `String.class` for both key and content types.
