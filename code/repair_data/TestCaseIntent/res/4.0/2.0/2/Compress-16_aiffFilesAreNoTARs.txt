Intent: The intent of the test case `aiffFilesAreNoTARs` is to verify that the method `createArchiveInputStream` correctly identifies that an AIFF audio file is not an archive format supported by any of the archive input streams (like ZIP, JAR, AR, etc.), and thus throws an `ArchiveException` indicating no suitable archiver was found for the stream signature.

Repair strategy: Inspect and refine the signature matching logic in `createArchiveInputStream` to ensure it accurately distinguishes non-archive files and does not falsely match them as a supported archive type. This may involve adjusting the signature byte patterns used for matching or enhancing the conditions under which these patterns are deemed a match. Additionally, ensure that the input stream's mark and reset operations are properly managed to maintain the stream's state across multiple signature checks.
