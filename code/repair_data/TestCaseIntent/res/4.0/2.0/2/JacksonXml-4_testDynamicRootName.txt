Intent: The intent of the test case `testDynamicRootName` is to ensure that the serializer respects the dynamically configured root name for both non-null and null objects. The test checks if the root name "rudy" is correctly used when serializing an object, a null field within an object, and a null object itself.

Repair strategy: Modify the `_serializeXmlNull` method to ensure that the root name provided via the configuration (in this case, "rudy") is used when serializing a null object. The current implementation of `_serializeXmlNull` seems to ignore or improperly handle the root name configuration when the value being serialized is null. The modification should involve checking and applying the configured root name even when the object to serialize is null.
