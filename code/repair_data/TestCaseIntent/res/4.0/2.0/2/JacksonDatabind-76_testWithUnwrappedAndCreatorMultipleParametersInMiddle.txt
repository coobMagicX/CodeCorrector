Intent: The test case `testWithUnwrappedAndCreatorMultipleParametersInMiddle` is intended to verify if the `Animal` class can be correctly deserialized from JSON when the parameters are provided in a non-sequential order and includes the use of both creator attributes and regular attributes. The test checks various fields of the `Animal` object, such as `id`, `name`, `age`, and `alive` status, to ensure they are set correctly.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly revise the deserialization logic in the `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` method to ensure that it correctly handles the order of JSON properties and the buffering of property values. The issue might be related to the property buffering or the handling of numeric values (like age) when creator properties are mixed with regular properties. Ensure that the deserialization process maintains the correct sequence and handling of JSON tokens, especially for properties processed through the creator and those buffered for later use.
