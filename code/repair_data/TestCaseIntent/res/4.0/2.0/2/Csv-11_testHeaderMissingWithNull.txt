Intent:
The intent of the test case is to validate the behavior of the CSV parser when dealing with a header that contains empty fields, which should be treated as nulls given the configuration to ignore empty headers is set to true. This configuration should ideally lead the parser to skip over or accept empty headers without throwing errors or duplicating entries.

Repair strategy:
The repair should focus on correctly handling empty headers in the presence of the 'ignoreEmptyHeaders' flag set to true. The source code needs to be adjusted to ensure that empty headers do not result in exceptions or incorrect mappings in the header map, especially when headers are duplicated due to being empty. This can be achieved by:
1. Revising the check and insertion logic in the loop that processes each header to ensure that empty headers are either skipped or handled correctly according to the 'ignoreEmptyHeaders' flag.
2. Ensuring that the logic that throws an exception for duplicate headers correctly considers and skips empty headers when 'ignoreEmptyHeaders' is true.
3. Adding specific condition checks before inserting headers into the `hdrMap` or before throwing exceptions for duplicates to handle scenarios where headers are empty and should be ignored.
