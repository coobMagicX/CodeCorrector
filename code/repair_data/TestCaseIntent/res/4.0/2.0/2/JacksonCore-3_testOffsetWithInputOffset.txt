Intent: The test case `testOffsetWithInputOffset` is intended to verify the correct handling of byte offsets when parsing JSON content with a specified input offset. The test checks that the parser correctly identifies the beginning of a JSON object and tracks byte offsets accurately from the point of the specified starting offset in the input byte array.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the implementation in `UTF8StreamJsonParser` constructor or related methods to ensure that the byte offsets are calculated correctly relative to the provided input offset (`start`). The error likely lies in how `_inputPtr` is initialized or used during parsing to calculate byte offsets. Ensure that the byte offset calculation accounts for the starting position (`_inputPtr`) accurately, especially when initialized with an offset (`start`) that skips certain bytes. This might involve adjusting how `_inputPtr` or `_inputEnd` is set or used in the computation of byte offsets in methods like `getTokenLocation()` and `getCurrentLocation()`.
