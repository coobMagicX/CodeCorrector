Intent: The purpose of the test case "testQuotedCharset" is to verify that the method `getCharsetFromContentType` correctly extracts and returns the charset from a content type string, properly handling cases where the charset is enclosed in quotes. This test aims to ensure that different variations of quoted charsets are accurately parsed, whether they are in lowercase, uppercase, or a standard charset format, and also handles unsupported charsets gracefully by returning null.

Repair strategy: Modify the `getCharsetFromContentType` method to properly strip the quotes around charset values in the `contentType` string before returning the charset. This could involve adjusting the regular expression used to match the charset in the content type or adding logic to remove quotes if they are detected around the extracted charset value. Additionally, ensure the method is case-insensitive or converts charsets to a consistent case format (e.g., all uppercase) before returning.
