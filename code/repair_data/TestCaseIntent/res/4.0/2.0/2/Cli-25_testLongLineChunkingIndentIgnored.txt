Intent: The test case `testLongLineChunkingIndentIgnored` is designed to verify that a command-line help formatter correctly wraps and indents long descriptions across multiple lines, respecting a specified maximum width and indentation settings. The test intends to check that the help output is formatted as expected, breaking long lines and indenting them correctly under specified constraints.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly modify the logic in the `renderWrappedText` method for handling text wrapping and indentation. Ensure the method respects the specified line width and tab stops when formatting text. Check for any off-by-one errors or incorrect calculations in how the `nextLineTabStop` is used and adjusted. Specifically, the code should be reviewed where the position (`pos`) to wrap the text is determined and how subsequent lines are padded. The logic that adjusts `pos` when `(text.length() > width) && (pos == nextLineTabStop - 1)` might be incorrectly setting `pos` to `width` instead of considering the required indentation. This might lead to incorrect line breaks or indentations. Adjust this calculation to more accurately reflect the intended line wrapping and indentation, especially for long argument descriptions in command-line help.
