Intent: The test `survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader` is designed to ensure that the `parsePaxHeaders` function can correctly handle and parse Pax headers in a TAR file even if there are blank lines or unexpected formatting within the Pax headers. This is critical for robustness, ensuring the TAR parsing functionality handles various edge cases gracefully.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on modifying the `parsePaxHeaders` function to properly skip over or ignore blank lines or any lines that do not conform to the expected "length keyword=value\n" format. This may involve adding checks that validate the format of each line before attempting to parse it as a header, and safely continuing with the next line if a format anomaly (such as a blank line or a line that does not contain "=") is detected. The repair could also include enhancements in error handling to prevent the parser from breaking or misbehaving upon encountering such anomalies.
