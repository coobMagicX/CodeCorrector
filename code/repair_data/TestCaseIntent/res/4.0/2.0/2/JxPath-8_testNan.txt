Intent: The intent of the test case `testNan` is to verify the behavior of the `compute` function when dealing with NaN (Not a Number) values in different comparison scenarios. It checks for greater than, less than, and equality conditions between NaN values and between a NaN and numeric values.

Repair strategy: Modify the `compute` method to properly handle comparisons involving NaN values. In floating-point arithmetic, any comparison operation involving NaN should return false, except for NaN equals NaN which should return true. The current implementation does not properly address comparisons with NaN, as it tries to treat NaN values as regular double values. The repair should include:

1. Checking if either `left` or `right` is NaN before performing any comparisons.
2. Returning the correct boolean values for comparisons involving NaN (e.g., false for greater than or less than, true for equals when both are NaN).
3. Ensuring that any utility method like `InfoSetUtil.doubleValue()` used in comparisons appropriately handles NaN values and does not lead to incorrect comparison logic.
