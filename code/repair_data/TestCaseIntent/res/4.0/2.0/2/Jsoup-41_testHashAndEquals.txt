Intent: The intent of the test case `testHashAndEquals` is to ensure that the `equals` method of the `Element` class correctly identifies when two elements are equal based on their content and attributes, and not just by their references. It also checks that the `hashCode` method is consistent with the `equals` method, such that if two objects are equal, their hash codes must also be the same.

Repair strategy: The source code for the `equals` method in the `Element` class is currently incorrectly implemented as it checks for reference equality twice and does not compare the actual content or attributes of the elements. The repair strategy should involve modifying the `equals` method to correctly compare the relevant fields or properties of the `Element` objects (such as tag name, attributes, and perhaps child elements) instead of checking reference equality. Additionally, ensure `super.equals(o)` is correctly utilized or implemented to handle inheritance properly, especially if any relevant properties are defined in the superclass. This approach will help ensure that `equals` behaves as expected when comparing different instances with identical content and attributes.
