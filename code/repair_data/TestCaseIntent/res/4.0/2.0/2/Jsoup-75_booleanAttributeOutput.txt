Intent:
The intent of the test case `booleanAttributeOutput` is to validate that the HTML output from the `html` method handles boolean attributes correctly. Specifically, it checks that boolean attributes are correctly minimized (e.g., "noshade" instead of "noshade="") and that non-true boolean values are explicitly output.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should involve modifying the code within the `html` method to ensure:
1. Boolean attributes that are set to true values (matching their names or other true equivalents like "true") are minimized correctly without an equals sign or value.
2. Boolean attributes set to any other value (like "false") should be output with their respective values.
3. Ensure the logic that checks whether an attribute is boolean and should be minimized is correctly implemented.
4. Adjust the condition checking within the `if` statement to carefully differentiate when an attribute value should be minimized and when it should explicitly include a value, particularly addressing the issue with attributes like `autofocus="false"`.
