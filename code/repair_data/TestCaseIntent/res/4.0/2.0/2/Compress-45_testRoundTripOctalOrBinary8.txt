Intent: The test case `testRoundTripOctalOrBinary8` is intended to verify that the `formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes` method can correctly format a given long value either in octal or binary format, based on its size and type (UID/GID or SIZE), when the buffer length is 8 bytes.

Repair strategy: The suspected issue in the source code appears to be related to the handling of buffer lengths and the conditions around when to format numbers as binary or octal. The method is supposed to handle different lengths and types of numeric values properly, switching between octal and binary as necessary. The specific problem could be the lack of a return statement after calling `formatLongBinary` in the case where `length` is less than 9, causing the method to proceed to `formatBigIntegerBinary` unnecessarily. A repair strategy would involve:

1. Adding an appropriate return statement after the `formatLongBinary` method call within the `if (length < 9)` condition block.
2. Ensuring that the method cleanly handles the transition between different formatting methods, especially ensuring that each conditional block that formats the value has a return statement to prevent fall-through to subsequent blocks when not intended.
3. Reviewing the conditions for switching between octal and binary formatting to ensure they correctly reflect the intended logic, especially considering the maximum allowable values and length constraints.
