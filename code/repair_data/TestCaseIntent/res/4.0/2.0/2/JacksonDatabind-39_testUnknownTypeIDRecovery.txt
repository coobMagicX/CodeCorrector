Intent: The test case `testUnknownTypeIDRecovery` is intended to verify that the deserialization process can gracefully handle JSON objects with unknown or invalid types specified in the `type` field, without failing the entire process. It aims to check if the deserialization can skip over or ignore the unrecognized item (`item` with `type` 'xevent') but correctly parse and include the recognized item (`item2` with `type` 'event') in the resulting `CallRecord` object. Additionally, it checks handling of other fields in the JSON to ensure they are correctly deserialized into the respective properties of `CallRecord`.

Repair strategy: The method `deserialize` currently skips all children of the parser indiscriminately, which results in losing all data in the JSON input. To pass the test case:
1. Modify the `deserialize` method to selectively skip only those JSON fields or objects that are explicitly invalid or unrecognized (based on the `type` field in this context), rather than skipping all content unconditionally.
2. Implement logic to effectively parse and include valid fields and objects into the resulting `CallRecord` object. This may involve checking the `type` attribute of each item and deciding whether to include it in the deserialization output based on its value.
3. Ensure that other fields (`version`, `application`) are correctly parsed and assigned to the `CallRecord` object. This might require implementing a more structured approach to JSON parsing and object mapping within the `deserialize` method.
