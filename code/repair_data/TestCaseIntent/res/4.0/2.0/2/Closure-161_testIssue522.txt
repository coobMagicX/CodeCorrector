Intent: The intent of the test `testIssue522` is to verify that the code handles cases where an assignment is made to an index position in an empty array. This is used to test the behavior of the method when attempting to assign a value to a non-existent index in an empty array, and it should likely result in an error or specific handling scenario.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling cases where the left-hand side (the array in this case) of an assignment within an array access expression is empty. The current method does not explicitly handle scenarios where the array is empty (`left` has no children) before attempting to access or assign to an index. The repair should include:
1. Adding a check at the beginning of the method to determine if `left`, the array node, is empty before proceeding with other logic.
2. Returning an error or handling the scenario appropriately when trying to assign to an index in an empty array to avoid proceeding with indexing logic that assumes the array has elements.
