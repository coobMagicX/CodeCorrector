Intent: The purpose of the test case `testMissingOptionsException` is to verify that the `checkRequiredOptions` method correctly identifies and throws an exception when required options are not provided by the user. The test aims to ensure that the exception message accurately lists all missing required options, formatted correctly.

Repair strategy: Update the `checkRequiredOptions` method to correctly format the list of missing required options in the exception message. This includes ensuring options are separated by commas and spaces where appropriate. Modify the loop that constructs the error message to add a comma and space between option names, but only if there are subsequent options to list. This will address the current error where options are concatenated without any separators, as indicated by the mismatch in the expected and actual messages in the test case.
