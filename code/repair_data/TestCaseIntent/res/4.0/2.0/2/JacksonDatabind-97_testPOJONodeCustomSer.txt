Intent: The test `testPOJONodeCustomSer` aims to serialize a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) embedded within a JSON tree structure using a custom serialization method, and compare the serialized output against an expected JSON string. The purpose is to ensure that custom serialization logic (such as appending additional text to values or custom formatting) is correctly applied when the POJO is serialized through a JSON tree node.

Repair strategy: Given that the failing line indicates a discrepancy in the output of the serialization when using `ObjectNode` (a type of JSON tree structure), the issue likely resides in how the `serialize` method handles instances that are wrapped in such tree nodes. The current implementation of the `serialize` method in the source code seems to handle direct instances of `JsonSerializable` correctly but might not properly handle cases where the serialization process needs to respect additional context or transformations defined outside of standard POJO serialization. 
- Examine and possibly modify the `serialize` method or the way `ObjectNode` handles the serialization of embedded objects.
- Ensure that any custom serialization logic (possibly indicated by the test with "The value is: Hello!") is correctly invoked even when the POJO is wrapped within an `ObjectNode`.
- Enhance the handling of context-specific attributes (`withAttribute` usage) in the serialization process to ensure that these are considered during the serialization of objects within `ObjectNode`.
