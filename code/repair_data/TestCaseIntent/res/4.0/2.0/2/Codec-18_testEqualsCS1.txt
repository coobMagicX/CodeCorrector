Intent: The intent of the test case `testEqualsCS1` is to verify that the `equals` method correctly determines whether two CharSequence objects are equal. This includes checking equality between null and non-null values, exact matches, and case sensitivity, as well as ensuring that differing lengths of char sequences are not considered equal.

Repair strategy: The fault-revealing line suggests that the `equals` method fails to correctly compare CharSequence objects of different lengths but with partly matching beginning sequences. The current implementation may incorrectly handle the comparison length or the way sequences are compared when they are not both instances of String but other types of CharSequence (like StringBuilder). The repair should ensure that the comparison strictly checks for both the content and the length of the sequences. Additionally, verifying that `CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches` method is correctly implemented or used in the context is crucial. Modify the method to handle non-String CharSequence comparisons by explicitly checking if the lengths of the sequences are equal before comparing their content. This may involve adjusting the current usage of `Math.max(cs1.length(), cs2.length())` to a more appropriate comparison mechanism that considers both the length and the content accurately.
