Intent: The test case `testEndMb` is intended to verify that the Caverphone encoding correctly processes words ending in "mb" by replacing "mb" at the start of words with "m2" and then removing '2's at a later stage in processing, leading to the expected encoded result where "mb" at the end of the word is replaced with an encoded representation of "m".

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the regular expression applied for handling "mb" at the beginning of words. It seems the rule is only aimed at the start of the string (`^mb`), which might not be handling cases where "mb" appears later or at the end of the string correctly. The replacement of subsequent '2's may also be incorrect or overly aggressive, leading to the removal of relevant characters. A specific rule to handle "mb" at the end of words differently from "mb" at the beginning should be introduced, ensuring that the encoded output matches the expected results in the test cases. Additionally, the final encoding steps should be verified to ensure that they preserve the correct characters and that the removal of '2's does not affect the necessary components of the encoding.
