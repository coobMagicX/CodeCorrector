Intent: The intent of the test case "caseSensitiveParseTree" is to ensure that the HTML parser correctly handles and preserves the case sensitivity of tags throughout the parsing process. This test aims to verify that the parser, when configured to preserve case, retains the original casing of tags in the parsed output, even if tags differ in case.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the handling of tag names in a case-sensitive manner within the HTML parser's process. To address this, the source code should be reviewed and modified to ensure that tag names are compared and stored in a manner that preserves their original case throughout the processing steps. Specifically, any functions or checks that normalize tag names to a specific case (like lowercase) should be adjusted to conditionally handle cases based on the parser's settings. This includes ensuring that the `anyOtherEndTag` function and related methods respect the case sensitivity settings when comparing and manipulating tag names.
