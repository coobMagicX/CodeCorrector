Intent: The purpose of the test case `testNineEmptyFiles` is to verify the functionality of the `writeBits` method when it is tasked to handle a scenario involving multiple (specifically nine) empty files. The method should be able to correctly process and write bits even when there is no data (0 bits) to write for each file.

Repair strategy: In the given `writeBits` method, the issue might stem from how the final bits are handled when there's no data to write (`length == 0`). The method's final conditional block (`if (length > 0 && shift > 0)`) attempts to handle leftover bits if not all bits have been written to the `header`. However, in cases where `length` is zero, this block will not execute, potentially leaving the method without any output or incorrect handling of the state when `length` is zero. The repair should ensure that the method can gracefully handle cases with zero-length input by checking and appropriately managing the state when `length` is zero, possibly by skipping processing steps that assume non-zero length. This includes ensuring proper initialization and resetting of variables like `cache` and `shift`, and managing output operations correctly when there's no actual data to write.
