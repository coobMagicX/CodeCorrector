Intent: The test case `absHandlesRelativeQuery` is designed to verify that the method `absUrl` correctly handles and resolves relative URLs that include query parameters. The test checks if the method can append a query string correctly to the existing path and handle a relative URL to a different file with a query string.

Repair strategy: Modify the URL construction logic in the `absUrl` method to preserve the base file path when a query string is appended directly to the base URL. Ensure that when the `relUrl` starts with a '?', it does not discard the existing file path of the base URL. This might involve checking the format of the `relUrl` and adjusting how `base` and `relUrl` are concatenated, possibly refining the condition or method used to combine these URLs to keep the file path intact when appending query parameters.
