Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1056` is to verify that the type checker can correctly handle type assignment and type inference when a variable declared with a specific type (`Array` in this case) is initialized to `null` and subsequently used in a method call (`.push('hi')`). The test aims to check if the type checker appropriately flags an error when attempting to call a method on a `null` value, ensuring type safety and adherence to declared types.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a mechanism to correctly handle the assignment and use of `null` to a typed variable, especially in the context of method calls. The repair direction should focus on:
1. Enhancing the type checking logic to handle cases where a variable declared with a specific type is assigned `null` and subsequently used. This might involve refining the logic in the `updateScopeForTypeChange` method or in the related type inference mechanisms of the scope handling.
2. Ensure that the type checker can flag an error or handle gracefully when methods are called on `null` values, specifically for variables declared with object types like `Array`. This could involve implementing additional checks when methods are invoked on variables whose current type is `null`, to prevent property access errors.
3. Improving the error messaging or the type enforcement in situations where type violations occur due to `null` assignments to typed variables, ensuring that the error messages are clear and accurately reflect the type violation.
