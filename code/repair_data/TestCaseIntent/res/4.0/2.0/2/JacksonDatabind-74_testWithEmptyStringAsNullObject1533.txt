Intent: The test case `testWithEmptyStringAsNullObject1533` is intended to verify that the deserialization process correctly interprets an empty string value ("") as a null object when the `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` is enabled in the ObjectMapper. This feature should allow JSON with empty string values to be interpreted as null when deserialized into Java objects.

Repair strategy: The existing source code in the `_deserializeTypedUsingDefaultImpl` method does not handle the case where an empty string should be returned as null based on the `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` setting. To resolve this issue, the code should be modified to check this configuration setting in the `DeserializationContext` and return null accordingly if an empty string is encountered during the deserialization process. Specifically, an additional condition should be implemented to verify if the current token is an empty string and the mentioned feature is enabled, then return null before further deserialization logic proceeds.
