Intent: The purpose of the test case `handlesControlCharactersAfterTagName` is to verify that the HTML cleaning function `Jsoup.clean` can correctly handle and sanitize HTML input that includes control characters following a tag name, ensuring that the resulting HTML output only contains valid and safe elements as defined by a whitelist.

Repair strategy: The source code likely needs enhancement in the area where it parses and handles attribute names. The current implementation trims whitespace from `pendingAttributeName` but does not handle other control characters which could still be present and cause the parsing to fail or behave unexpectedly. The repair should focus on extending the sanitization process to include stripping out or properly handling all non-valid characters (including control characters) from `pendingAttributeName` before attempting to create an attribute with it. This could involve adjusting the condition or method used to clean or validate `pendingAttributeName` before it is used to create new attributes.
