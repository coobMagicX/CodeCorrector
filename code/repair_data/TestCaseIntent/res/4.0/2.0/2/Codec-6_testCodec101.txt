Intent: The purpose of the `testCodec101` method is to validate the behavior of the `Base64InputStream` class when it deals with a base64 encoded input. The test aims to ensure that the `read` method correctly reads data from an input stream and properly handles the end-of-stream condition. The first assertion checks if data is successfully read, and the second assertion verifies that subsequent reads indicate the end of the stream.

Repair strategy: The test failure at the line `assertTrue("Codec101: First read successful [c=" + c + "]", c > 0);` suggests that the `read` method in the `Base64InputStream` class might not be correctly handling the data decoding or the internal buffer management. One possible issue could be that the `readResults` method does not correctly return the number of bytes read or mishandles buffer updates, especially when data is partially or fully decoded in the buffers.

1. **Verify Buffer Management:** Ensure that the buffer management logic within the `read` method properly handles scenarios where the buffer is partially filled. This includes checking conditions under which the buffer is initialized and used within the method.

2. **Check Data Decoding Logic:** Ensure that the `encode` and `decode` methods are correctly processing the input bytes and that any conditions affecting their output (like input size being a multiple of a certain number) are handled correctly.

3. **Review End-of-Stream Handling:** Ensure that the method correctly identifies and handles the end-of-stream conditions, potentially by checking if the underlying stream (`in`) has more data to read before attempting further decoding or encoding operations.

4. **Examine `readResults` Method:** Since the failure occurs after attempting to read data, it is crucial to review the `readResults` function to ensure it correctly calculates and returns the number of bytes read and properly signals end-of-stream scenarios. This could involve checking how it interacts with internal states and buffers.

By focusing on these aspects, the source code can be adjusted to ensure correct functionality as expected by the `testCodec101`.
