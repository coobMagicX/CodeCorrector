Intent: The purpose of the test case `testHWRuleEx1` is to validate the encoding logic for names using a custom mapping and rules, specifically focusing on handling characters adjacent to 'H' or 'W'. The test aims to ensure that these special cases are handled correctly to match expected encoding results, such as "A261" for "Ashcraft" and "Y330" for "yehudit" as per the given examples.

Repair strategy: Review the implementation of `getMappingCode` and `getStringEncoder().encode()` methods to ensure that the handling of characters adjacent to 'H' and 'W' is consistent with the intended encoding rules. The specific error in the failing test case suggests that the method may incorrectly handle sequences where 'H' or 'W' immediately precedes another character without properly isolating or ignoring them as required. The repair should focus on correctly implementing the rule that ignores 'H' and 'W' when adjacent to similar mapped characters or to each other, to ensure accurate character mapping and encoding.
