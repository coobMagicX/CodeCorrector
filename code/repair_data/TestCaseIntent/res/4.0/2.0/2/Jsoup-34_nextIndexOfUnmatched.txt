Intent: The test case `nextIndexOfUnmatched` is designed to check the correctness of the `nextIndexOf` function when the sequence to be found does not exist in the input string. The expected behavior is for the function to return -1, indicating that the sequence `"]]>"` is not found in the input string `"<[[one]]"`.

Repair strategy: The problem is likely due to an incorrect handling of sequence matching, particularly at the end of the input string or when the sequence is not found at all. To repair the source code, ensure that:
1. The loop correctly handles cases where the first character of the sequence is found but the subsequent characters do not match.
2. Properly handle cases where the search reaches the end of the string without finding the sequence.
3. Verify that the function returns -1 when the entire sequence cannot be found from the current position to the end of the input string. This involves checking the logic that determines if the end of the sequence has been reached and if all characters up to that point match the sequence.
