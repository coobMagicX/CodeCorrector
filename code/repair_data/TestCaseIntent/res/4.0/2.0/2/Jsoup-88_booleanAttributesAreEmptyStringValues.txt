Intent:
The intent of the test case `booleanAttributesAreEmptyStringValues` is to verify that boolean attributes in HTML (like `hidden` in `<div hidden>`) are parsed correctly by the `Jsoup` library, such that the attribute exists but contains an empty string as its value.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should focus on ensuring the `Jsoup` library's parsing logic correctly interprets boolean attributes without a value as having an empty string (`""`) as their value. This may involve adjusting the HTML parser to recognize boolean attributes and assign them an empty string value when no explicit value is provided.
