Intent: The test case `testDontQuoteEuroFirstChar` is designed to verify that the CSV output does not quote a string starting with the Euro character when the quoting policy is set to a mode that does not require non-numeric values to be quoted, specifically under `CSVFormat.RFC4180` which uses `MINIMAL` quoting.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the conditions in the `MINIMAL` case of the `quoteModePolicy` switch statement to correctly handle special characters like the Euro character at the beginning of a string. The current logic may be too conservative in determining when to quote based on the ASCII value of the character. Ensure non-ASCII characters like the Euro symbol are handled correctly according to the specified format's requirements without unnecessary quoting. Additionally, confirm that the `CSVFormat.RFC4180` is indeed set to use the `MINIMAL` quoting mode and that this setting is honored throughout the `printAndQuote` method.
