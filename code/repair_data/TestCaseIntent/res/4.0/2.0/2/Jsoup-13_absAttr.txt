Intent: The test case `absAttr` checks if the method `attr(String key)` correctly retrieves absolute URLs from HTML elements' attributes. The goal is to ensure that the method can handle different scenarios, including elements with relative URLs, elements with absolute URLs, and a collection of elements.

Repair strategy: The source code provided does not include the implementation for handling absolute URLs in attributes directly. The repair should focus on modifying or extending the `attr` method or related functionality to correctly compute absolute URLs when requested. This could involve checking if the attribute key is seeking an absolute URL (i.e., prefixed with `abs:`) and then resolving the relative URL against the document's base URL if necessary. Ensure this logic is compatible with both single and multiple element scenarios.
