Intent: The test case `testDoubleMetaphoneAlternate` aims to verify that the `doubleMetaphone` method returns the correct alternate phonetic encoding for each string in the `TEST_DATA` array when the second parameter is set to `true`.

Repair strategy: Review and debug the `doubleMetaphone` method to ensure it correctly computes the alternate phonetic representations for all inputs specified in `TEST_DATA`. Ensure that all possible phonetic rules and exceptions are handled appropriately in the method. Debug each branch in the `handleG` function and related functions for potential logical errors or incorrect string manipulations that might be contributing to the discrepancies in the expected output.
