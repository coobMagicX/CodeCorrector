Intent: The intent of the test case `consumeToNonexistentEndWhenAtEnd` is to check the functionality of `consumeTo(char c)` method in the `CharacterReader` class. The test ensures that when attempting to consume until a character that does not exist in the buffer (from the current position), the method should return an empty string and that the reader should still be empty afterward.

Repair strategy: Based on the failure in the line `String after = r.consumeTo('>');`, the potential issue in the source code might be related to how `consumeTo(char c)` handles cases where the character `c` is not found in the buffer. The method might incorrectly handle the buffer's end or return incorrect results when the end of the buffer is reached without finding the character.

1. Ensure that `consumeTo(char c)` correctly checks the entire buffer from the current position to the end for the character `c`.
2. If the character `c` is not found, the method should return the correct substring (which could be an empty string if the cursor is at the end of the buffer) and ensure the buffer's position is handled correctly (e.g., moved to the end).
3. Add checks or modify existing ones to handle edge cases where the buffer is already at its end or nearly empty, ensuring that the method behaves as expected in these scenarios.
