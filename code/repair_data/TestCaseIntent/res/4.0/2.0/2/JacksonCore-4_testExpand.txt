Intent: The purpose of the test case `testExpand()` is to ensure that the `expandCurrentSegment()` method in the `TextBuffer` class successfully increases the size of the buffer each time it is called, until the buffer size reaches or exceeds 500,000 characters. This is to test the buffer's dynamic resizing capability.

Repair strategy: The code should ensure that the buffer size always increases with each call to `expandCurrentSegment()` until it reaches a specified maximum size. The failure suggests that the buffer does not expand as expected under certain conditions, particularly when reaching the `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`. The strategy should involve:
1. Reviewing and possibly revising the growth condition and calculation in `expandCurrentSegment()`, ensuring the buffer always increases in size from its previous state unless it has hit the maximum allowed length.
2. Ensure that the `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` is defined and handled correctly, and consider implementing a more robust check or a clearer incremental logic when the buffer size is close to or at `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`.
3. Testing edge cases around `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` to ensure they handle size increases appropriately and predictably.
