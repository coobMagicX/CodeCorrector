Intent: The intent of the test case `shortTextFilesAreNoTARs` is to ensure that the method `createArchiveInputStream` correctly fails to create an archive input stream from a `ByteArrayInputStream` which does not contain actual archive data, specifically not a TAR archive. The test aims to verify that the method can accurately detect non-archive data and throw an appropriate exception.

Repair strategy: The code should be inspected and potentially updated to ensure that the logic for archive detection (especially for TAR archives) correctly identifies only valid archive signatures and not mistakenly identify plain text or incorrect formats as TAR or any other type of archive. This could involve refining the condition checks in `TarArchiveInputStream.matches` or adjusting how the input stream is analyzed and processed in the `createArchiveInputStream` method. Additionally, ensure that the exception handling within the method adequately captures and reports situations where non-archive data is processed, thereby preventing false positives from passing through as valid archives.
