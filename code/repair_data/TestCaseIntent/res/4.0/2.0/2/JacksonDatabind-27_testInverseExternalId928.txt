Intent: The purpose of the failed test case `testInverseExternalId928` is to ensure that the deserialization of JSON data into Java objects functions correctly even when the order of fields in the JSON string is altered. Specifically, the test checks whether the class can handle JSON where the 'class' field precedes the 'payload' field, which contains nested JSON object data.

Repair strategy: The issue likely stems from the handling of external type identifiers and the order in which properties are processed during deserialization. The source code should be modified to better manage the state and dependencies between fields when they are encountered out of the typical order. This can be achieved by ensuring that the external type handler (`ext`) and the property buffer (`buffer`) are robust against varying orders of JSON properties. Additionally, adding checks or reordering mechanisms that handle dependencies between 'class' and 'payload' fields in the deserialization method could resolve the issue. Consider revising the logic where external type IDs and property dependencies are managed, possibly enhancing how objects are built with `creator.build()` and ensuring that type checks or instance creations are order-independent.
