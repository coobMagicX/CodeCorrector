Intent:
The intent of the test case `testInnerEmptyNamespaceDOM` is to verify that the method `getNamespaceURI` correctly retrieves the namespace URI for a given DOM node, especially focusing on nodes that might not directly declare a namespace but inherit it or have a specific handling scenario (such as empty or undeclared namespaces).

Repair strategy:
1. **Safeguard Type Casting**: Ensure that the node being cast to `Element` is actually an instance of `Element`. This is crucial since the input node to `getNamespaceURI` could be of a different subtype of `Node`, which might not support the `Element` specific methods and could lead to a `ClassCastException`.
2. **Handle Namespace Inheritance and Declaration**: Enhance the method to better handle cases where namespaces are inherited from parent nodes rather than declared directly on the node itself. This includes improving the logic that searches for the `xmlns` attribute by climbing up the DOM tree to find a declaration when it's not found on the immediate node.
3. **Null Checks and Error Handling**: Implement additional null checks and error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where certain assumptions (like the presence of specific attributes or nodes) fail. This will prevent runtime exceptions and ensure that the method returns meaningful results or null where appropriate.
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Extend the unit tests to cover more edge cases related to namespace handling, such as nodes without any namespace, nodes with default namespaces, and nodes where the namespace is declared higher up the DOM tree.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Update the method documentation and inline comments to clearly describe the behavior and logic, especially explaining how namespaces are resolved and inherited in complex DOM structures.
