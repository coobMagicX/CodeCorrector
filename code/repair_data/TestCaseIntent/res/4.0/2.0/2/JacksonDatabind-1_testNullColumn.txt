Intent: The purpose of the test `testNullColumn` is to verify that the `serializeAsColumn` method correctly handles an instance of `TwoStringsBean` where one or both of the string fields are `null`. The expected output is a JSON array with a null value and a non-null string ("bar").

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the null handling in `serializeAsColumn` method aligns with the intended JSON output format. The test failure suggests that the JSON output is not correctly rendering null values when present in the `TwoStringsBean` object. The repair should focus on:
1. Verifying the implementation of `_nullSerializer` to ensure that it correctly serializes null values.
2. Ensuring that the condition checking and invocation of `_nullSerializer` and the fallback `jgen.writeNull()` are functioning as expected when `TwoStringsBean` fields are null.
3. Checking if `TwoStringsBean` is properly accessed within `get(bean)` and if it correctly identifies and processes null fields.
4. Confirming that any custom serialization logic for handling nulls does not interfere with the expected output format specified in the test case.
