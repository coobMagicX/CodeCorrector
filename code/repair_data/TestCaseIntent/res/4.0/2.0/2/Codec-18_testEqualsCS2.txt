Intent: The purpose of the test case `testEqualsCS2` is to verify that the `equals` method correctly compares different instances of `CharSequence` (like `String` and `StringBuilder`) for equality based on their content, length, and case sensitivity.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that the `equals` method can accurately compare different implementations of `CharSequence` in terms of content length and case sensitivity. Particularly, the method should handle cases where the lengths of the char sequences differ. This can be achieved by checking the lengths of the sequences before comparing their content and ensuring that the case sensitivity comparison is consistent for all implementations of `CharSequence`. Adjust the logic in the `equals` method to handle these edge cases properly, possibly refining the conditional checks or the method used for comparison when the objects are not both instances of `String`.
