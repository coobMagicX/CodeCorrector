Intent: The purpose of the test case `handlesCustomProtocols()` is to verify if the `testValidProtocol()` function correctly identifies and preserves custom protocols ("cid" and "data") in URLs when they are explicitly allowed in a whitelist. This ensures that images with these protocols are not dropped during the cleaning process by Jsoup.

Repair strategy: The repair should involve modifying the `testValidProtocol()` method to ensure that it correctly handles and preserves custom protocols specified in the protocols set. This might require:
1. Checking if the method correctly interprets and matches the protocol part of the URL against the set of allowed protocols.
2. Ensuring that the method does not inadvertently modify or fail to recognize valid protocols when the URL is converted to lowercase.
3. Verifying that the method correctly handles protocol comparison, possibly adjusting how protocols are added to the comparison set (ensuring the ':' character handling is consistent and correct).
4. Reviewing how absolute URLs are generated and used in the method, to confirm they retain the protocol information accurately when `preserveRelativeLinks` is false.
