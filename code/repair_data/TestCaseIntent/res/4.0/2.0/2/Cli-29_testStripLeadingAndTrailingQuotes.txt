Intent: The function `stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes` is intended to remove only the leading and trailing quotes of a given string, if present. Its purpose is to clean up strings that are enclosed in quotes, while leaving internal quotes within the string untouched.

Repair strategy: Adjust the function to only check and remove quotes at the very beginning and end of the string, ensuring not to remove quotes that are part of the internal contents of the string. This might involve more precise checking of the positions where the quotes are located, ensuring they are exactly at the first or last character of the string.
