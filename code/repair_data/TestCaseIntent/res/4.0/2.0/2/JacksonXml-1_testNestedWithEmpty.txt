Intent: The test case `testNestedWithEmpty` aims to validate the parsing of an XML structure into a `ServiceDelivery` class instance using a custom XML-to-JSON mapper. It specifically checks that an empty `VehicleMonitoringDelivery` XML element is correctly interpreted as a non-null and non-empty collection within the `ServiceDelivery` object.

Repair strategy: Inspect and modify the XML-to-JSON mapping logic to appropriately handle and represent empty XML elements as non-empty collections in the resulting JSON object. This likely involves adjusting the conditions under which empty XML elements (such as `<VehicleMonitoringDelivery></VehicleMonitoringDelivery>`) are parsed and converted into JSON collection types. The mapping logic should ensure that empty XML tags are not skipped or misrepresented as null or empty arrays/lists in the JSON output. This may involve tweaking the parsing conditions or the way empty elements are handled during the XML to JSON transformation inside `nextToken()` method, specifically the handling and interpretations of `XML_END_ELEMENT` and related token processing logic to ensure empty collections are represented accurately.
