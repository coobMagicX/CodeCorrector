Intent: The test case `testSimple` intends to deserialize a JSON string into an instance of `JsonRoot` class using Jackson's `ObjectMapper`. This involves converting the JSON representation of data into Java objects, ensuring the JSON structure matches the expected structure of `JsonRoot` and its nested types.

Repair strategy: The likely issue causing the failure in the test case seems related to type resolution in the `_narrow` method of the `SimpleType` class. The method is used for type narrowing, but it does not properly check if the desired subclass is actually a subclass or implementor of the original class, which could lead to incorrect type casting or class mismatch errors during deserialization. To repair:
1. Re-enable or rewrite the class hierarchy check in `_narrow` to ensure that `subclass` is a valid subtype of `_class` before proceeding with the creation of a new `SimpleType`.
2. Ensure that the type handling in deserialization properly uses this method to prevent class cast exceptions or misinterpretations of the type hierarchy.
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging within the deserialization process to better trace the root causes of type resolution failures.
