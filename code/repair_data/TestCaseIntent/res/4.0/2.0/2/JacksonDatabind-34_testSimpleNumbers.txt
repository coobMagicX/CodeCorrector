Intent: The test case `testSimpleNumbers` is designed to ensure that the method `acceptJsonFormatVisitor` correctly handles and invokes appropriate visitors for different numeric types such as `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger`. The intent is to verify that the correct `numberType` is appended to a `StringBuilder` for each type, reflecting accurate JSON format handling.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly handle the type `BigDecimal` by using `JsonParser.NumberType.BIG_DECIMAL` instead of `JsonParser.NumberType.BIG_INTEGER` when calling `visitFloatFormat`. This will ensure that the `numberType` for `BigDecimal` instances is correctly recognized and processed as `BIG_DECIMAL` rather than incorrectly as `BIG_INTEGER`. Adjustments should be made in the conditional blocks that determine how different classes are handled, particularly focusing on ensuring that each numeric type maps to its corresponding `JsonParser.NumberType`.
