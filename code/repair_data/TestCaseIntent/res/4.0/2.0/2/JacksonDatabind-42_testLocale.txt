Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the method correctly deserializes an empty string into the `Locale.ROOT` instance, as opposed to any other locale or a null value. This is intended to ensure that the method handles edge cases where the input string is empty, returning a default or root locale as per specific requirements.

Repair strategy: Modify the `_deserializeFromEmptyString()` method to specifically handle the case for `Locale` similar to how URI is handled. When the `_kind` variable indicates that the type is `Locale`, the method should return `Locale.ROOT` instead of calling `super._deserializeFromEmptyString()`. This will ensure that deserializing an empty string results in `Locale.ROOT` for locale types, matching the expected outcome of the test case.
