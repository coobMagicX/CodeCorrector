Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the `shortRec.toMap()` method when handling a CSV record that has fewer fields than the headers defined in the CSV format. The test aims to verify how the method maps header names to corresponding field values in the presence of missing fields.

Repair strategy: To address the failure, the source code should be modified to handle cases where there are fewer values in a record than there are headers. This could involve:
1. Adjusting the `toMap()` method to check if the index for a given header exceeds the available fields in the record. 
2. If a header does not have a corresponding value because the record is short, the method could either skip adding this header to the map or assign a default value (such as `null` or an empty string) to ensure robustness and avoid `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
