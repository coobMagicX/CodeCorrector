Intent: The intent of the test case `testEscapedCharacter` is to verify that the Lexer correctly handles and returns a string with an escaped character that does not correspond to a known escape sequence (like `\n`, `\t`). It tests the Lexer's ability to process and return strings containing unrecognized escape sequences correctly, here specifically testing with `\a`.

Repair strategy: Update the `readEscape()` method in the source code to handle unknown escape sequences by returning the character following the escape symbol '\\' as it is, without transformation, when it does not match any recognized escape sequences. This will involve adding a default case in the switch statement to handle and return unrecognized characters directly. Additionally, ensure that the method properly concatenates the unrecognized escape character back into the returned string in the main Lexing process.
