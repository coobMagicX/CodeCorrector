Intent: The intent of the test case `testCopyWith` is to verify that when copying an `XmlMapper` instance and modifying its features (specifically disabling `USE_ANNOTATIONS`), the serialization behavior changes accordingly. Specifically, it checks that the original `XmlMapper` uses annotations to determine the XML element name, while the copied and modified `XmlMapper` does not, using the default class name instead.

Repair strategy: Ensure that when copying an `XmlMapper` instance, the configuration related to annotation usage is also duplicated correctly, and changes made to the copy (like disabling `USE_ANNOTATIONS`) should reflect in the behavior of the serializer. This might involve modifying the copy constructor or method in `XmlMapper` or related classes to ensure that features and configurations related to annotations are correctly handled during the copy operation.
