Intent: The intent of the test case `testUnmodifiable` is to verify that the `ObjectMapper` can correctly deserialize JSON representing an unmodifiable set into an instance of a set that maintains the unmodifiable property. The test ensures that the deserialized set is empty and adheres to the characteristics of an unmodifiable collection.

Repair strategy: The potential issue could be related to the handling of type information during deserialization, specifically with unmodifiable collections. The source code should include logic to properly recognize and instantiate collections as their unmodifiable versions when specified by type information in the JSON. This may involve enhancing the `createContextual` method or related components to recognize and respect additional metadata indicating immutability or special collection types like unmodifiable sets. Adding or refining the handling of such metadata could resolve the deserialization issue observed in the test case.
