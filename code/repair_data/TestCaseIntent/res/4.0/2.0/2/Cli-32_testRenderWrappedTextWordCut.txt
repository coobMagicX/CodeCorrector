Intent: The test case `testRenderWrappedTextWordCut` is designed to verify that the method `renderWrappedText` correctly wraps a string of text to a specified width, breaking between words or at the maximum width limit if no suitable breaking point (like spaces or new lines) is found within words. The intent here is to ensure that long words that exceed the width limit are cut and placed on a new line without breaking the word unless necessary.

Repair strategy: A key issue in the source code appears to be in the method `findWrapPos`, which is likely used by `renderWrappedText` to determine where to wrap the text. The `findWrapPos` method has logic to handle whitespace and special characters (newline, tab), but fails to correctly handle cases where no suitable whitespace exists within the width limit. The method should be updated to:
1. Correctly handle cases where the entire word length exceeds the specified width, ensuring that it either finds a suitable earlier break point or allows the word to cut off at the maximum width.
2. Modify the loop that searches for the last whitespace or permissible break character to correctly handle cases without any such characters within the specified width, moving to the next line without breaking the word.
3. Ensure the method can handle strings without spaces, and properly wrap at the maximum width when no natural break points (like spaces or punctuation) are available within the width limit. This might involve modifying the logic that determines the return position when no suitable whitespace is found.
