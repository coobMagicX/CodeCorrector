Intent:
The purpose of the test case `readEntriesOfSize0` is to validate the behavior of reading entries within a 7z archive file. Specifically, it checks if the entries named "2.txt" and "5.txt" are empty (i.e., they should return -1 when attempting to read, indicating no data), and that other entries contain data (should not return -1 when read). The test also verifies the total number of entries in the archive file.

Repair strategy:
The test case failure suggests that reading from the stream does not behave as expected for empty files, possibly due to incorrect handling of streams in the `getCurrentStream()` method. The method should correctly handle and return an empty stream or correctly signal the end of the stream for empty files. A potential repair direction would be to modify the `getCurrentStream()` or related stream handling methods to ensure that when an entry is empty (0 size), the stream appropriately signals this state (potentially by immediately returning -1 for reads). Additionally, confirm that the stream handling does not inadvertently consume or skip valid data for non-empty entries.
