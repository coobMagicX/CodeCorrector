Intent: The test case `handlesAbsPrefixOnHasAttr` checks whether the method `hasAttr` correctly identifies when an element has an absolute URL attribute (`abs:href`) in addition to a relative URL attribute (`href`). It validates the method for both elements with only relative URLs and elements with absolute URLs.

Repair strategy: Modify the `hasAttr` method to recognize and correctly handle attribute keys prefixed with "abs:". This may involve adding a special condition to check for this prefix and appropriately querying the underlying attribute set or URL resolution logic to determine if an absolute URL attribute exists.
