Intent: The purpose of the test `testCanonicalNames` is to verify that the method `toCanonical` correctly returns a canonical name representation for various types, including simple classes, generic collections with and without type specifications, and special reference types. The test ensures that the canonical name can be used to reconstruct the same type, preserving its full specification.

Repair strategy: The source code appears to fail in handling complex generic types with nested type parameters (`AtomicReference<Long>` in this case). To repair the code, ensure that the `buildCanonicalName` method correctly builds the canonical name string for types with nested generics. This could involve recursively processing the nested type parameters and appending their canonical representation to the string builder. Additionally, make sure that the method properly handles cases where type parameters are unspecified, defaulting them to `java.lang.Object` as the test cases expect. This might require checking and handling null or default values in `_referencedType`.
