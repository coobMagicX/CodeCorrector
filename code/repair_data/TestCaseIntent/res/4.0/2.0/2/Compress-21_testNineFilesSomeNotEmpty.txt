Intent: The test case `testNineFilesSomeNotEmpty()` aims to examine the functionality of a compression or encoding system that handles scenarios with multiple files, specifically 9 files where some files are not empty. The purpose here is to ensure that the system can successfully compress or encode a group of files, handling both empty and non-empty files correctly.

Repair strategy: Investigate and potentially correct the handling of bit shifts and boundary conditions in the `writeBits` method. The error might be due to improper reset of the `shift` variable or incorrect handling of the last bits when the total number of bits (`length`) isn't a multiple of 8 (or does not perfectly fill the last byte). Ensure that the method correctly writes the remaining bits to the output when the loop completes, especially under conditions where the exact number of bits does not align with byte boundaries (e.g., 9 files might lead to a bit count not divisible by 8). This might involve adjusting how the final bits are written to ensure all data is accurately encoded or compressed, regardless of the total length.
