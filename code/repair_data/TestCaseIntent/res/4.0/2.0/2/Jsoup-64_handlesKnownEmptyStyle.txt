Intent: The test case is intended to verify that the parser correctly handles self-closing style tags within the HTML head section by properly converting them to explicitly closed tags. This is important for HTML correctness and browser rendering.

Repair strategy: Modify the `handleRawtext` function or its associated methods to ensure that self-closing tags like `<style/>` are converted into open and close tag pairs (`<style></style>`) in the parsed HTML output. This might involve adjusting the tokenization or parsing rules to treat empty elements in a context-sensitive manner, especially for elements like `<style>` that conventionally require explicit closing tags.
