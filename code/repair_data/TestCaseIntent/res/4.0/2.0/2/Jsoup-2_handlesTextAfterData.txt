Intent: The test case `handlesTextAfterData()` intends to verify that the parser correctly handles and retains text placed after a script tag within HTML content. This is to ensure that text nodes both before and after embedded script tags are preserved as part of the document structure.

Repair strategy: Examine and potentially modify the `parseStartTag()` method to ensure that text following a script or similar data-containing tag is correctly parsed and added to the document. This may involve reviewing how text nodes are handled following the closure of a script tag's parsing loop (`if (tag.isData())`). Ensuring that the parsing cursor is correctly positioned after a script or data tag and that subsequent text is properly captured and added to the DOM structure is key to resolving the issue.
