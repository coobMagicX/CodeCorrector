Intent: The test case `shouldReadBigGid` is intended to verify that the TarArchive system can correctly handle and read large group IDs (GIDs) that are beyond the typical range for 32-bit integers, specifically using the POSIX BigNumber mode. It checks the ability of the system to work with GIDs near the upper limit of 32-bit unsigned integer range.

Repair strategy: The potential issue could be that the TarArchiveEntry or the TarArchiveInputStream does not correctly handle or interpret the large values set for GIDs in BigNumber mode. To fix the issue, ensure that:
1. The `setGroupId` and `getLongGroupId` methods (or their internal usage) are capable of handling long integer values properly.
2. The BigNumber mode setting (`TarArchiveOutputStream.BIGNUMBER_POSIX`) is correctly influencing the way GIDs are written and read back, ensuring there's no data truncation or incorrect data type handling during the serialization and deserialization process.
3. Review and possibly update how the TarArchiveInputStream parses and handles the GID field from the stream, particularly ensuring it respects the BigNumber mode and correctly processes 64-bit values.
