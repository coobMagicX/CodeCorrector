Intent: The intent of the test `testArrayWithDefaultTyping()` is to verify that the `ObjectMapper` configured with default typing correctly parses JSON arrays and objects. It checks if the parsed `JsonNode` from a JSON array string is indeed an array with the correct size, and similarly for a JSON object, it verifies if the parsed `JsonNode` is an object with the correct properties and values.

Repair strategy: The error likely lies in the `useForType` method within the `_appliesFor` switch cases. The method should correctly identify and process Java types based on the specified conditions like handling non-concrete types, arrays, and ensuring it does not incorrectly apply to JSON tree models. The repair should focus on:
1. Ensuring that the fall-through logic in the switch cases is intentional and correctly handled. For instance, after checking for arrays in the `NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS`, it falls through to `OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE` without a break statement, which might be unintended and could cause incorrect type handling.
2. Correcting the duplicated and possibly incorrect return statements (like `return t.isJavaLangObject() || return (t.getRawClass() == Object.class)`), which might cause compilation errors or logical errors in determining the type.
3. Verifying and possibly fixing how `TreeNode.class.isAssignableFrom(t.getRawClass())` is used, ensuring it does not wrongly exclude or include types that should not be processed as JSON tree models.
4. Reviewing the handling of array types to ensure that the content type of arrays is correctly identified and processed, especially in recursive scenarios where arrays might contain other arrays or non-concrete types.
