Intent: The test case is intended to verify that the HTML parser correctly handles unclosed anchor (`<a>`) tags when they are followed by other tags such as `<p>`. The parser should automatically close the unclosed `<a>` tag before starting the `<p>` tag and re-open a new `<a>` tag for subsequent content within the `<p>` tag, ensuring the structure remains valid.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the HTML parser's token handling for end tags correctly identifies and closes any unclosed formatting elements before opening a new block-level element like `<p>`. This might involve adjusting the logic in the handling of end tags (or implicitly in start tags of block-level elements) to check for and close any open formatting tags like `<a>`. Additionally, verify that the parser maintains correct nesting by re-opening the formatting tags if needed after opening the new block element.
