Intent: The purpose of the test `testNotAllowMultipleMatches` is to ensure that the filtering mechanism in the JSON parser only matches the first instance of a specific field name ("value") when the `multipleMatches` flag is set to false. This test aims to verify that subsequent occurrences of the field "value" are ignored, and only the first match is considered.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the logic within the `FilteringParserDelegate` or associated filtering mechanism to strictly adhere to the `multipleMatches` flag. Particularly, ensure that once a match is found, no subsequent matches are considered if `multipleMatches` is false. This might involve setting a state or flag indicating that a match has already been processed and checking this state as part of the decision-making process when encountering potential matches. Additionally, verify the correct extraction and conversion of the matched value to ensure it matches the expected result format ("3").
