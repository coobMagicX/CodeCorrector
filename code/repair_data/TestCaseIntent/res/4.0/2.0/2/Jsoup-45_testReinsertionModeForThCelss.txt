Intent: The test case `testReinsertionModeForThCells` is designed to verify the correct behavior of HTML parsing, particularly how the parser handles nested tables within a `<th>` element. The test seems to intend to check that the parser correctly understands and maintains HTML structure, especially the nesting and hierarchy of tables within table headers.

Repair strategy: The source code should include logic to correctly handle and transition states when encountering `<th>` elements, similar to how it currently handles `<td>` elements. This could involve:
1. Adding a condition to check for "th" nodes in the `resetInsertionMode` method.
2. Ensuring that the transition to the appropriate state (likely `HtmlTreeBuilderState.InCell`) is made when a "th" element is encountered.
This would ensure that the parser maintains the correct document structure when parsing `<th>` elements, which seems to be overlooked in the current implementation.
