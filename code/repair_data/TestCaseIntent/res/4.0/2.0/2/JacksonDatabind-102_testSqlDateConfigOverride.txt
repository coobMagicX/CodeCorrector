Intent: The test case `testSqlDateConfigOverride` is intended to check if the `ObjectMapper` can correctly serialize a `java.sql.Date` object using a custom date format specified through a configuration override. The custom pattern "yyyy+MM+dd" should be used instead of the default pattern, converting the date "1980-04-14" to the string "1980+04+14".

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the `createContextual` method properly handles the configuration overrides for date formats. Specifically, verify that when the `JsonFormat.Value` contains a custom pattern, this pattern is correctly applied to the `SimpleDateFormat` used for serialization. Check the logic that handles `DateFormat` cloning and modifications to ensure that any newly set patterns, locales, or time zones are effectively utilized. If necessary, refactor the handling of `DateFormat` instances to correctly apply configuration overrides, especially for instances that are not `SimpleDateFormat`, as these seem not handled or incorrectly handled leading to potential misconfiguration or default behavior usage.
