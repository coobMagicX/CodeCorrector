Intent: The code is intended to parse unquoted JSON fields and tokens correctly, handling various input buffer sizes and character types (including special characters and control characters beyond typical ASCII range).

Repair strategy: The function `_handleOddName2` needs to be revised to ensure it accurately handles edge cases such as long sequences of whitespace and non-typical characters like those with values greater than 255. Specifically, the handling of characters whose code is greater than `maxCode` should be checked, as it might be causing issues with characters like `256` which appear in the test case. Additionally, ensure that the buffer expansion and character handling logic maintains the integrity of the parsed data, especially when transitioning between buffer segments. Consider adding more robust error handling or validation within the loop to catch and manage unusual or malformed input sequences gracefully. This could involve refining the condition checks for breaking out of the loop or improving the logic for buffer management when near buffer limits.
