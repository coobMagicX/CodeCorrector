Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testCompressedHeaderWithNonDefaultDictionarySize` is to validate the correct processing of a 7z file that uses a non-default dictionary size during compression. The test aims to ensure that the application can handle compressed files with altered dictionary sizes correctly, opening the file and reading its contents without errors.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should focus on ensuring the `decode` method correctly interprets the dictionary size from the `properties` of the `coder`. The current implementation of bit-shifting and masking in calculating `dictSize` may be incorrect or the integration with `LZMAInputStream` might not properly support non-default dictionary sizes. Revising the bit manipulation logic for accuracy and verifying compatibility or correct parameter passing to the LZMAInputStream constructor would be key. Ensure that any size transformations or interpretations align with the expected input specifications of LZMAInputStream and the LZMA compression standard.
