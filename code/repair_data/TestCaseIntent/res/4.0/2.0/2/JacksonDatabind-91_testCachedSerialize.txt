Intent: The purpose of the failing test case is to ensure that the custom key deserializer is being used during the deserialization process of a JSON string into a MapHolder class. The test checks if the keys in the deserialized map are transformed according to the custom deserializer, which presumably should append " (CUSTOM)" to the original keys.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the custom key deserializer is correctly registered and utilized in the ObjectMapper instance used for deserialization. This may involve reviewing and potentially modifying the configuration of the ObjectMapper or the way the custom deserializer is attached to the MapHolder class or its fields. Additionally, the source code method `_hasCustomHandlers` should be examined to verify if it correctly identifies the presence of custom handlers (both value and type handlers) for container types and their content types, which may affect the deserialization process. Ensure that the method accurately reflects the conditions under which custom handlers are present, especially for map-like types where key handlers might be key.
