Intent: The test case `testMapToProperties` is intended to verify that the `MAPPER.convertValue` method can successfully convert a `Bean` object into a `Properties` object, ensuring that all bean properties are correctly transformed into string key-value pairs in the `Properties` object, even if they are not initially of type String.

Repair strategy: The failing test case indicates that the conversion of non-string types (like integers) to string values in the `Properties` object is not handling as expected. The source code needs to be adapted to ensure that all values, regardless of their original type, are converted to String types when mapped to a `Properties` class. This might involve adjusting the `convertValue` method or ensuring the `_mapType` method (or related serialization/deserialization logic) correctly identifies and handles the special case of `Properties`, potentially through custom type conversion or a type adapter.
