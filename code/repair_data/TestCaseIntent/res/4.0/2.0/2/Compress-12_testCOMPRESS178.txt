Intent: The test case `testCOMPRESS178` is designed to verify that the `getNextEntry` method properly throws an `IOException` when encountering an issue that warrants it, with an `IllegalArgumentException` as the expected cause of the IOException. This test is likely focusing on error handling when processing malformed or unexpected tar archive content.

Repair strategy: Review the implementation of the `getNextEntry` method (or similar methods that the test case interacts with) to ensure that it correctly identifies errors and throws an `IOException` with the appropriate cause. The source code should be adjusted to either directly throw `IOException` with `IllegalArgumentException` as the cause, or modify the error handling logic so that underlying methods throw `IllegalArgumentException` when appropriate, which should then be wrapped in an `IOException` if not already doing so. This adjustment will ensure that the method behaves as expected under error conditions as assumed by the test case.
