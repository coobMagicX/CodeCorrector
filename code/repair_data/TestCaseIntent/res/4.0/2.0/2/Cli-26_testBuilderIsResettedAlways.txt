Intent: The test case `testBuilderIsResettedAlways` is intended to ensure that the `OptionBuilder` is properly reset after each use. This is to confirm that no residual properties (like description) from previous operations are carried over to new `Option` instances created subsequently.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `OptionBuilder.reset()` is effectively resetting all properties of the `OptionBuilder` after an `Option` is created. This could involve checking and modifying the `reset()` method to ensure all fields of the `OptionBuilder` are appropriately cleared or reinitialized. The issue likely arises because the `reset()` method does not fully clear the state, or it is not being called at the correct moment in the `create` method. Adjust the placement of the reset call if necessary, and confirm all attributes are reset.
