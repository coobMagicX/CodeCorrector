Intent: The failing test case intends to validate that the date serialization adheres to a specified format without a predefined pattern attribute in the JSON format annotation. It checks that the custom date format set on the ObjectMapper is correctly applied when serializing a Date object.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to properly handle cases where a custom `DateFormat` is set on the `SerializerProvider` (in this case, ObjectMapper), even if no specific pattern is provided in the JSON format annotations. This includes ensuring that the custom format is used instead of defaulting to another format or the standard ISO8601 format when `format.hasPattern()` is false. Consider enhancing the logic that determines when to use the provided `SimpleDateFormat` from the `SerializerProvider`. This may involve checking if a custom `DateFormat` is set in the provider and using it directly when no specific pattern or shape is dictated by the `JsonFormat.Value`.
