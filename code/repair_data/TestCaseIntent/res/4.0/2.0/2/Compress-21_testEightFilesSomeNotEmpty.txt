Intent: The intent of the test `testEightFilesSomeNotEmpty` is likely to verify the functionality of the `writeBits` method when it is used to handle a specific scenario where the data to be compressed consists of 8 elements and some of these elements are non-empty or true bits. The method should correctly compress this data into the output stream, handling both the true and false bits accurately across the given length.

Repair strategy: The likely bug in the `writeBits` method could be related to mishandling the boundary cases where the total number of bits (`length`) is not a multiple of 8, leading to incorrect or incomplete writing of the last few bits. The resetting of the `shift` variable and the final write operation outside the loop may not be handling all scenarios effectively.

1. **Boundary Condition Check**: Ensure that after the main for-loop, the method correctly checks if there are any remaining bits in the cache that haven't been written to the output. This involves a more robust handling of the condition when `shift != 7` after the loop finishes.

2. **Shift and Cache Reset**: Verify that the logic for resetting `shift` and `cache` within the loop is correctly set up so that no bits are lost when transition happens from one set of 8 bits to another, especially when `shift` becomes zero and needs resetting.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**: Additional unit tests should be created to handle cases where the length of `bits` is exactly on the boundary of 8 bits, slightly less than a multiple of 8, and more than a multiple of 8, ensuring that the method behaves correctly in all these scenarios.
