Intent:
The intent of the test case `testRfc4648Section10Encode` is to verify that the `encodeBase64String` method correctly encodes input strings into their Base64 representation according to RFC 4648 Section 10. This test checks various lengths and contents of strings to ensure that padding and encoding are handled correctly.

Repair strategy:
The failure of the test case suggests that the `encodeBase64` method within `encodeBase64String` may not be handling the Base64 encoding correctly, particularly with respect to padding or character encoding. The repair strategy should focus on ensuring that the `encodeBase64` method:
1. Correctly pads the output when the input byte array's length is not divisible by three (since Base64 encoding processes data in blocks of three bytes).
2. Accurately maps input bytes to the correct Base64 characters without any off-by-one or similar errors.
3. Utilizes the appropriate character encoding when converting the byte array to a string (UTF-8 as specified).

This may involve debugging the `encodeBase64` method to check for errors in the encoding algorithm or reviewing how the padding is added in scenarios where the input string length causes incomplete byte triplets. Additionally, confirming that the `StringUtils.newStringUtf8` function properly converts byte arrays to UTF-8 encoded strings without altering data is crucial.
