Intent: The test `workaroundForBrokenTimeHeader` is intended to verify the correct reading and interpretation of a TAR archive entry using a custom `TarArchiveInputStream`. The test checks if the file name, the last modified date, and the symbolic link status are correctly parsed and returned as expected.

Repair strategy: The test case failure at `tae = in.getNextTarEntry();` suggests an issue with parsing the TAR entry, potentially due to incorrect handling of tar header fields (like time fields) in the `parseOctal` method. The `parseOctal` method is responsible for parsing octal values from a buffer which could be used in interpreting file metadata such as file size, modification times, etc. The repair should focus on ensuring that the `parseOctal` method correctly handles edge cases, such as non-standard tar header formats or unexpected characters within the octal fields. Specifically, the method should robustly handle cases where time headers might not conform strictly to expected formats, possibly due to variations in tar implementations across different systems (like AIX in the test case). This could involve adding additional checks or fallback mechanisms to interpret unusual or non-compliant header values without failing.
