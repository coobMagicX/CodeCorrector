Intent: The test case "testCollectedFunctionStubLocal" aims to verify that a function constructor `f` correctly initializes a property `foo` on its instances, that the property `foo` is explicitly annotated with a return type of `number`, and that this property is recognized and not inferred but explicitly declared in the type system.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly modify the implementation in the source code that handles the attachment of properties and their types to function constructors within local scopes. Ensure that the `defineDeclaredFunction` method or similar functionality correctly processes and registers properties and their types as specified in JSDoc annotations within function constructors. This includes ensuring that properties like `foo` are not only attached but also recognized as explicitly declared rather than inferred.
