Intent: The test "handlesDataOnlyTags" is designed to verify that the parser correctly handles tags that are typically used to encapsulate data (like <style> and <script> tags), ensuring that the data within these tags is not treated as visible text on the page. It checks that the text extracted from a document containing such tags excludes the content within <style> and <script> tags, while the data method correctly retrieves the content inside these tags.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the parser recognizes <style> and <script> tags as raw text elements where the text inside these elements should not contribute to the visible text output of the document. Modify the parsing logic to differentiate between visible text and raw data inside these specific tags, ensuring that methods like `text()` do not return the contents of <style> and <script> tags, but methods like `data()` do. This might involve adjusting the state transitions or the handling of these tags in the tokenizer to ensure they are processed as raw text elements.
