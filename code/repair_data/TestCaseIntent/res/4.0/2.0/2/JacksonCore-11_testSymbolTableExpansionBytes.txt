Intent: The test case `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` is intended to check whether the symbol table (likely managed by arrays `_hashArea` and `_names`) expands correctly when handling byte-based inputs. This involves verifying that the table can grow and rehash its contents properly under certain conditions, likely triggered by the input type or size.

Repair strategy: Given the failure and the source code method `_verifySharing`, which is supposed to ensure that the symbol table's internal state is correctly managed (specifically, handling shared state and rehashing needs), it appears that the method may not adequately address all conditions necessary for correctly managing the expansion of the symbol table. The repair strategy should include:
1. Ensuring that the `_verifySharing` method is called at appropriate points before the table is accessed or modified, particularly ensuring it's part of any method that alters the table size or contents.
2. Revisiting the rehash logic within the `rehash()` method to ensure it correctly handles all scenarios, particularly when expanding the table based on byte inputs.
3. Checking if `_hashArea` and `_names` are correctly copied and resized in scenarios where `_hashShared` is true, and ensuring that any flags or conditions needed for proper rehashing are correctly set or reset during and after the copying process.
4. Adding thorough unit tests to specifically test the conditions under which the symbol table is expected to expand, ensuring the test covers various edge cases related to byte handling and table resizing. 

By addressing these points, the source code should be better equipped to handle the conditions that led to the failure of the `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` test case.
