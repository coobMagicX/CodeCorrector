Intent: The test's purpose is to evaluate the JSON deserialization process using a custom deserialization problem handler. The handler is designed to manage unknown type IDs by returning a constructed type (`Void.class`). The test verifies that the deserialization process does not fail and correctly handles unknown type IDs, ensuring that the `GenericContent` object and its inner objects are properly instantiated and populated.

Repair strategy: Based on the test failure, it appears that the deserialization process may not be handling unknown type IDs correctly, despite the custom handler. The source code should be reviewed to ensure that the `_handleUnknownTypeId` method integrates effectively with custom deserialization problem handlers. Additionally, the method should be adjusted to properly utilize the type returned by the problem handler, instead of potentially ignoring it and returning `null`. The repair should ensure that when a custom handler provides a fallback type (`Void.class` in this case), the deserializer utilizes this type to continue the deserialization process, rather than failing or returning `null`. This can involve modifying the logic that deals with the case where `actual` is not `null` to properly handle and use the type provided by the problem handler.
