Intent: The intent of the test `testElementSiblingIndexSameContent` is to ensure that the method `elementSiblingIndex` correctly returns the index position of each paragraph element (`<p>`) within its parent container (`<div>`), even when multiple elements have identical content.

Repair strategy: Investigate and modify the `elementSiblingIndex` method to ensure it correctly identifies the index of each element based on its position rather than matching by content or any other attributes. This may involve refining the equality comparison within the method to focus strictly on positional context rather than content similarity.
