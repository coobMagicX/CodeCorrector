Intent: The intent of the test case `testLongLineChunkingIndentIgnored` is to validate that the `HelpFormatter` correctly formats and wraps a long option description into multiple lines, respecting the specified width and indentations for subsequent lines.

Repair strategy: The existing implementation of `renderWrappedText` may not correctly manage the indentation for wrapped lines, particularly when the indentation (nextLineTabStop) is substantial relative to the specified width (22 in the test case). The method should be modified to correctly calculate the wrap position when the remaining width after accounting for the indentation is significantly small. This involves refining the logic that computes `pos` to ensure that subsequent lines after the first correctly start after the specified indentation and do not exceed the total width. Additionally, the logic that appends the padding for subsequent lines should be audited to guarantee that it correctly calculates the starting position and length of the substring to be appended, especially when handling edge cases where the text just fits or slightly exceeds the available width after indentation.
