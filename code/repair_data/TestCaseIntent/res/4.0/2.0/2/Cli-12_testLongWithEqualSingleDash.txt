Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLongWithEqualSingleDash` is to verify that the parser correctly handles and extracts the value "bar" from the command line argument "-foo=bar" when the option "foo" is defined in the options as a long option with an argument.

Repair strategy: The issue seems to be in the handling of single-dash long options combined with an equals sign for specifying arguments. The source code should be adjusted to correctly parse and separate the option and its argument when formatted as "-foo=bar", ensuring that it is recognized as a valid option and its value is correctly extracted. The repair should involve modifying the option parsing logic to differentiate between single-dash long options and to split the argument from the option when an equals sign is present, even if the option starts with a single dash. This will ensure compatibility with the test case expectations and correct functionality for similar input formats.
