Intent: The test case `sameHeadersCombineWithComma` is designed to verify that if a single header field is presented with multiple values, these values should be combined into a single string with each value separated by a comma. This follows the HTTP/1.1 specification for handling multiple message-header fields with the same field name.

Repair strategy: Modify the `processResponseHeaders` method to check if there are multiple values for a header name and combine them using a comma separator before setting the header value. Currently, the method only uses the first value (`values.get(0)`) for any header. The code should iterate over the `values` list and concatenate them, separating them by commas, before calling the `header` function to set the combined value.
