Intent: The test case "testBackwardsTypedefUse2" is intended to verify that the type resolution mechanism correctly handles typedefs (type aliases) in JavaScript, even when the typedef is used before it is defined. The test involves a function 'f' annotated to have 'this' of a type 'MyTypedef', which is defined after its use, as a union type of 'Date' and 'Array'.

Repair strategy: Modify the type resolution logic to handle forward references to typedefs. This could involve two potential strategies:
1. Delay the resolution of types until all typedefs are processed or known, which might require reordering of type resolution or storing unresolved types in a temporary structure until their definitions are encountered.
2. Implement a mechanism that rechecks unresolved types once all typedefs are defined in the scope, ensuring that any forward-referenced typedefs are resolved at the end of the parsing or type-checking process.
