Intent: The test case `quoteReplacements` is designed to verify that the `unescape` function correctly decodes HTML entities representing the backslash (\\) and dollar sign ($) characters from their respective numeric character references `&#92;` and `&#36;`.

Repair strategy: The current implementation may be failing to properly handle the conversion of numeric character references to their corresponding characters. One possible issue could be the check `if (charval != -1 || charval > 0xFFFF)`. This condition is flawed as it does not properly handle characters within the valid Unicode range, and it uses a logical OR where a logical AND might be required. The repair should involve correcting this conditional check to ensure that valid characters are correctly appended to the output string. Additionally, ensuring that the decoding of numeric character references (both decimal and hexadecimal) is correctly implemented will be crucial.
