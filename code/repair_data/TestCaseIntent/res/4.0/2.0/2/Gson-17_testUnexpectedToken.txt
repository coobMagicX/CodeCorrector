Intent: The test case 'testUnexpectedToken' is designed to validate that the `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` correctly handles and throws an exception when an unexpected JSON token (in this case, an empty JSON object `{}`) is encountered instead of a string representation of a date. The purpose is to ensure robustness and correctness of the date parsing logic in scenarios where the input JSON does not match the expected format.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to correctly handle cases where the JSON token is not a STRING. Currently, the `read` method only checks for `JsonToken.STRING` and throws an exception if it's not a string, but the behavior when encountering other tokens (like a JSON object) is not handled as expected by the test. The repair should include:
1. Extending the existing condition to properly throw a `JsonParseException` when the token is not a string, ensuring that the exception type and handling align with the expectations set in the test case.
2. Ensure consistency in exception types between the source code and test cases, possibly replacing `IllegalStateException` with `JsonParseException` in the catch block of the test case to match the exception thrown by the source code. This will lead to clearer and more maintainable error handling in the application.
