Intent: The test case is designed to verify that the method `newStringIso8859_1` handles null input gracefully by returning a null output instead of throwing an exception.

Repair strategy: Modify the `newStringIso8859_1` method to explicitly check if the input byte array is null and return null if true. This will ensure that the method behaves consistently with the expected output when provided with null input, thereby passing the test case.
