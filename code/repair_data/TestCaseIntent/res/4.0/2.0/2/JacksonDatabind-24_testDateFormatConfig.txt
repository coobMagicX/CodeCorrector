Intent: The test case `testDateFormatConfig` is intended to verify that the timezone configuration of the ObjectMapper remains unchanged when a new DateFormat with a different timezone is set. The test ensures that despite changing the DateFormat's timezone, the ObjectMapper's serialization and deserialization configurations should retain the original timezone set explicitly earlier.

Repair strategy: Modify the `withDateFormat` method in the `BaseSettings` class to ensure it does not inadvertently change the `_timeZone` field when a new `DateFormat` is set. Specifically, check and ensure that the timezone of the ObjectMapper (or related settings object) remains unchanged unless explicitly modified by the relevant timezone setting methods, rather than changing as a side effect of setting a new DateFormat. Adjust the logic that determines the timezone to be used in the new `BaseSettings` instance, ensuring it retains the original timezone unless explicitly modified.
