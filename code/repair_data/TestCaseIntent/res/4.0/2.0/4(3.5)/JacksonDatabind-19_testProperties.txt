Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the `mapType` method when constructing a `MapType` for a `Properties` class. It checks that the constructed `MapType` has the correct key type and content type.

Repair strategy: The `mapType` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when the `Properties` class is passed as the `rawClass`. Currently, it constructs a `MapType` with unknown type parameters, which is incorrect. The repair direction is to update the `mapType` method to handle `Properties` class as a special case and construct the `MapType` with correct type parameters for key and content types.
