Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the functionality of writing a binary object as an embedded object using the `writeEmbeddedObject` method.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should be to implement the necessary support for writing embedded objects. This may involve modifying the `writeEmbeddedObject` method to handle binary objects correctly.
