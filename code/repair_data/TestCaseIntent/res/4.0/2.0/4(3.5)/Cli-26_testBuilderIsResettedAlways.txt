Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the OptionBuilder class when creating options with invalid arguments, and to verify that the builder is reset properly.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the reset behavior of the OptionBuilder class. The builder should be reset after each option creation to ensure that no properties or values are carried over to subsequent calls.
