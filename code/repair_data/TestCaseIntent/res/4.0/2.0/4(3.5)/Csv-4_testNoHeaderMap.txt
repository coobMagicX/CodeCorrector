Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the method `getHeaderMap()` returns null when there is no header map available.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle the case when there is no header map available. The `getHeaderMap()` method should be updated to check if the header map is null and return null in that case.
