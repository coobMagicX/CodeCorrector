Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the functionality of compressing multiple files when some of them have non-empty content.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the length of bits is not a multiple of 8. Currently, if the length is not a multiple of 8, the last byte is not written to the header. The repair strategy would involve adding logic to write the remaining bits in the cache to the header after the loop ends, if the length is greater than 0 and shift is greater than 0.
