Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the deserialization process correctly assigns the value for the "first_name" property of the "Name" object inside the "Animal" object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve investigating why the value for the "first_name" property is not being assigned correctly. It is possible that there is an issue with the deserialization logic for the "Name" object.
