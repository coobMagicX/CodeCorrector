Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to check if the constructor of the DocumentType class can handle a blank name parameter.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue would be to modify the code in the constructor to handle the case when the name parameter is blank. This could involve adding a condition to check if the name is empty and handling it accordingly.
