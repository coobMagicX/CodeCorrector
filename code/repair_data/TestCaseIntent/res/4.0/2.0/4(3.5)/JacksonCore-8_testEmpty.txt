Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the length of the text buffer is 0 after calling the `getTextBuffer()` method.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy is to ensure that the `getTextBuffer()` method returns an empty array when the text buffer is empty. This can be achieved by modifying the code to return an empty array at the appropriate condition.
