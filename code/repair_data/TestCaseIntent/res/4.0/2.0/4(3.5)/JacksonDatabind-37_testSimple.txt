Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the deserialization of a JSON string into an instance of the `JsonRoot` class using the `ObjectMapper` class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this code would involve fixing the deserialization process to correctly handle the input JSON string and deserialize it into an instance of the `JsonRoot` class.
