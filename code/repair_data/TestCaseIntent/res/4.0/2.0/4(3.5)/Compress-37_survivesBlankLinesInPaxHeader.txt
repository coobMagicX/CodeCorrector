Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to check if the code can correctly handle blank lines in a Pax header.

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to handle blank lines in the Pax header. This can be done by adding a check for blank lines and skipping them when processing the keyword-value pairs in the header.
