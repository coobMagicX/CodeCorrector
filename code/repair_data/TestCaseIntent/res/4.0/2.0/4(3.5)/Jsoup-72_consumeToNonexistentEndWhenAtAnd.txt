Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify the behavior of the `consumeTo` method when trying to consume characters until a specific character ('>') is encountered.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve analyzing the implementation of the `consumeTo` method and identifying any potential errors that might cause it to fail. Based on the fault-revealing line, it seems like the `consumeTo` method is not working correctly in this scenario. The repair direction would be to investigate the implementation of the `consumeTo` method and fix any issues that prevent it from correctly consuming characters until the target character is found.
