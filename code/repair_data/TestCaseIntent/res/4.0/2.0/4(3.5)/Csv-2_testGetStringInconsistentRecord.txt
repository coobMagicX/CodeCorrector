Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the "get" method of the "recordWithHeader" object when the header mapping is inconsistent with the record values.

Repair strategy: To pass the test case, the source code needs to handle the case where the header mapping is inconsistent with the record values. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the index obtained from the mapping is within the bounds of the "values" array. If the index is out of bounds, the method should return null.
