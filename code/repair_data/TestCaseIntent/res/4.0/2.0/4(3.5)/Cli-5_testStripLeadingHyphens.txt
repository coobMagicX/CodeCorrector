Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the functionality of the "stripLeadingHyphens" method. It specifically tests the behavior of removing leading hyphens from a given string.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the case when the input string is null. Currently, the code throws a NullPointerException, causing the test case to fail. The repair direction should involve adding a null check before performing any operations on the string.
