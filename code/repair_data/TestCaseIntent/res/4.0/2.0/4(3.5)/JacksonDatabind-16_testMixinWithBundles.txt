Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the ObjectMapper correctly applies the mixin annotation to the target class and produces the expected JSON output.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve investigating why the expected JSON output is not being produced. It is possible that the mixin annotation is not being properly applied or that there is an issue with the serialization process. The repair direction should focus on debugging and fixing any issues related to applying the mixin and generating the correct JSON output.
