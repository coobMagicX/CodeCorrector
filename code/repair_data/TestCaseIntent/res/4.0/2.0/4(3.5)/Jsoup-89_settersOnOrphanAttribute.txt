Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `setValue` method on an orphan attribute.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on correcting the logic in the `setValue` method to handle orphan attributes properly. Specifically, the code should check if the `parent` is null before attempting to access it.
