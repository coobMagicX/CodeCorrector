Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that the "style" tag is correctly handled in the HTML document.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue is to modify the "handleRawtext" method to handle the case when a self-closing "style" tag is encountered. This can be done by checking if the start tag is a self-closing tag and appending the closing tag if necessary.
