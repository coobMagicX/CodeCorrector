Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the source code correctly handles a JSON input with snake_case property names and maps them to the corresponding constructor parameter.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the source code to correctly handle the snake_case property names and map them to the constructor parameter. This may involve implementing a conversion mechanism to transform the snake_case property names to the appropriate parameter names in the source code.
