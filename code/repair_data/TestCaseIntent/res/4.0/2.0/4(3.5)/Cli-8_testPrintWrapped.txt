Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `renderWrappedText` method in the source code. The test cases aim to verify that the method correctly wraps text and adds padding when necessary.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly wrap the text and add padding based on the given width and nextLineTabStop values.
