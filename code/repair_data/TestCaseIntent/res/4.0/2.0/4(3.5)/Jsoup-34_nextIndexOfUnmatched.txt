Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the method `nextIndexOf()` correctly returns -1 when the input sequence is not found in the `CharacterReader`.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this failing test case is to fix the code logic in the `nextIndexOf()` method to correctly handle cases where the input sequence is not found.
