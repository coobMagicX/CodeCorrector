Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the writeBits() method when given a length of 7 and no bits to write.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code should focus on handling the case where the length is greater than 0 but the shift is still greater than 0. Currently, the code only checks if the length is greater than 0 to determine if the remaining cache should be written.
