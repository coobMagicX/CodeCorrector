Intent: The intent of the test case is to validate the functionality of the file name option in the command line parser.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on identifying any issues with the command line parser that are causing it to fail when parsing the file name option. This may involve examining the parser implementation and how it handles the file name argument.
