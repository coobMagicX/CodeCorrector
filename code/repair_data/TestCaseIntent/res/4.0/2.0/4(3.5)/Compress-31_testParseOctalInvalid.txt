Intent: The intent and purpose of the failing test cases is to verify that the parseOctal method correctly handles invalid input and throws an IllegalArgumentException when necessary.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle the cases where the input is invalid and throw an IllegalArgumentException. Specifically, the code should check for empty byte arrays, byte arrays with only one element, and byte arrays with invalid characters (spaces, NULs, or characters outside the range of '0' to '7'). The code should throw an IllegalArgumentException with an appropriate exception message in these cases.
