Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to deserialize a JSON string into an object of type Authentication1872 using the ObjectMapper.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this issue is to investigate why the deserialization is failing and potentially modify the source code to handle the deserialization of the Authentication1872 class correctly. This may involve checking if the class name is in the list of illegal class names and handling it accordingly.
