Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the skipValue() method correctly skips over the current value in a JSON object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve checking the current token type before skipping the value. If the current token type is a JSON object name, the nextName() method should be called to move to the next name in the object. If the current token type is not a JSON object name, the popStack() method should be called to move to the next value in the object.
