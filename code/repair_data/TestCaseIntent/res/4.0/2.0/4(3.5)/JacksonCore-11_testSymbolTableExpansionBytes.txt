Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify the expansion of the symbol table when using bytes.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue with symbol table expansion. This can be done by ensuring that the `_needRehash` flag is set correctly and the `rehash()` method is called when needed.
