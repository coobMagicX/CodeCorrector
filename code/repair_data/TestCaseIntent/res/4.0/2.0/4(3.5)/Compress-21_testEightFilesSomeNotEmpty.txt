Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the method `writeBits` with 8 files, where some of the files are not empty.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to check if the `length` parameter is greater than 0 before writing the cache to the header. This will ensure that a cache is only written if there are bits to be written.
