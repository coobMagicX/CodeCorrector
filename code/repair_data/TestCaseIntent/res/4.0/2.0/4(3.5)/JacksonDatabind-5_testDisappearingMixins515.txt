Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the registered mixin annotation is correctly applied during serialization.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue would involve ensuring that the mixin annotation is properly applied during serialization. This may require checking the implementation of the `_addMethodMixIns` method to ensure that the mixin methods are correctly added to the `AnnotatedMethodMap` and that they are properly used during serialization.
