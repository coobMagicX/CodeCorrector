Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that an UnrecognizedOptionException is thrown when an unrecognized option is encountered.

Repair strategy: The source code should throw an UnrecognizedOptionException when an unrecognized option is encountered. The repair direction is to modify the code to throw the exception when the option is not found in the options list.
