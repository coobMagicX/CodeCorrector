Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the lexer correctly handles the escaped value "character\\NEscaped" by returning it as a token.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to ensure that the lexer correctly recognizes and returns the escaped value "character\\NEscaped" as a token. This may involve fixing any issues in the code that prevent the lexer from correctly processing the escape sequence.
