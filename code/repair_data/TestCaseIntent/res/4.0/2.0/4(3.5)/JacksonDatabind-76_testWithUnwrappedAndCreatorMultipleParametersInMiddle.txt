Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the deserialization of an Animal object with unwrapped properties and a creator with multiple parameters in the middle works correctly.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this failed test case is to ensure that the deserialization correctly assigns the value of the "years_old" property to the "age" field of the Animal object.
