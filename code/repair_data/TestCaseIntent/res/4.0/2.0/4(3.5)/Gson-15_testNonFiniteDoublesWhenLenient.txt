Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify the behavior of the `JsonWriter` when non-finite double values (such as NaN, Positive Infinity, and Negative Infinity) are written.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling non-finite double values correctly in the `value` method of the `JsonWriter` class. This could be done by modifying the code to check for non-finite values and handle them appropriately, such as writing "NaN", "-Infinity", and "Infinity" as strings instead of throwing an exception.
