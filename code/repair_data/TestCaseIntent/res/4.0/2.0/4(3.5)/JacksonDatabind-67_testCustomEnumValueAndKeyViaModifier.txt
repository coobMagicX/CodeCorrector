Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of custom key deserialization for enums using a modifier.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the custom key deserialization for enums using the modifier. This may involve checking the implementation of the `modifyKeyDeserializer` method in the `BeanDeserializerModifier` class and ensuring that the deserialization logic is correctly implemented.
