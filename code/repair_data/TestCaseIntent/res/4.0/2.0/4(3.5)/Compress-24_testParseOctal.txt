Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the "parseOctal" method in the TarUtils class. The test cases are checking whether the method correctly parses octal values from a byte array and returns the expected long value.

Repair strategy: Based on the failed test cases, it seems that the "parseOctal" method is not correctly handling the trailing spaces and null bytes in the input byte array. The repair direction would be to modify the code in the "parseOctal" method to properly trim the trailing spaces and null bytes before parsing the octal value.
