Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to check if reading from a truncated entry in a ZIP file throws an exception.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the source code to throw an exception when attempting to read from a truncated entry in a ZIP file. This will align the behavior of the source code with the expected behavior in the test case.
