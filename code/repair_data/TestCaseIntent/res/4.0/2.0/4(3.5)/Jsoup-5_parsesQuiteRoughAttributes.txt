Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to check if the parseAttribute() method can correctly parse various types of attributes in an HTML tag.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the parsing of attributes in the parseAttribute() method. It seems that the code is not handling certain attribute formats correctly, leading to incorrect parsing results. The fix should focus on correctly identifying and extracting the key-value pairs of attributes from the HTML tags.
