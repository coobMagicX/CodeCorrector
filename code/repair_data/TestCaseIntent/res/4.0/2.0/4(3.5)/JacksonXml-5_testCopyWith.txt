Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify that the XmlSerializerProvider correctly handles copying with certain configurations disabled. The test checks if the copied XmlMapper instance produces the expected XML output.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the issue with the incorrect variable being used in the fail assertion. The variable `xml1` should be replaced with `xml2` in the fail assertion to correctly display the XML value.
