Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `getLength()` method in the source code. The test cases are checking for the correct handling of null values and the correct calculation of the length for different XPath queries.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling null values correctly and ensuring that the length is calculated accurately for different XPath queries. It may involve modifying the `getLength()` method to handle null values and improving the logic for calculating the length. Additionally, any issues with the XPath queries used in the test cases should be addressed.
