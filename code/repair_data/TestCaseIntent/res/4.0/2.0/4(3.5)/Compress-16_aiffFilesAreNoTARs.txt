Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that creating an ArchiveInputStream for a non-archive file throws an ArchiveException with the message "No Archiver found".

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the source code to correctly handle non-archive files and throw the expected ArchiveException with the appropriate message.
