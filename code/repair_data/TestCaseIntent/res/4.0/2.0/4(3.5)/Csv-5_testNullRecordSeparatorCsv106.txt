Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that the format string does not end with the word "null" when a null record separator is used in the CSV format.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the source code to handle the case of a null record separator correctly. This could include checking if the record separator is null and handling it appropriately, such as using a default record separator or throwing an exception.
