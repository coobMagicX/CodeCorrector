Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the code when processing properties with different values.

Repair strategy: Based on the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the code's handling of property values that are not "yes", "true", or "1". The repair direction would be to modify the code to properly handle these values and add the option to the CommandLine only if the value meets the specified conditions.
