Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the deserialization of a JSON object into a Map with CharSequence keys and String values.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue is to modify the source code to handle the deserialization of a JSON object into a Map with CharSequence keys. Currently, the code only supports specific types for deserialization. The repair direction would be to add a check for CharSequence.class in the if-else ladder and handle the deserialization accordingly.
