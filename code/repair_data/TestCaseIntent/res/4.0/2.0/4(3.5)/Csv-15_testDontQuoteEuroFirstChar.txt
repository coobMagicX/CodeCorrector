Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to ensure that the CSVPrinter does not quote the first character of the EURO_CH string.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the logic in the "printAndQuote" method to correctly handle the EURO_CH string without quoting its first character.
