Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to check if the code can handle an unclosed CDATA section at the end of an HTML document.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code to handle the case of an unclosed CDATA section at the end of the document. This can be done by adding logic to handle CDATA sections and properly parsing them.
