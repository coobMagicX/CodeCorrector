Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the behavior of parsing unquoted fields in JSON.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy to fix the failing test cases is to investigate the implementation of the `_handleOddName2` method and check if it correctly handles unquoted fields in JSON. The issue could potentially be related to the condition checks for unquoted fields and the handling of characters in the input buffer.
