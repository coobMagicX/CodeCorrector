Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the `getValue()` method returns an empty string for a specified attribute.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to ensure that the `getValue()` method returns an empty string for the specified attribute. The potential error in the code could be that the `getValue()` method is not properly implemented to return the value of the attribute. The repair strategy would involve modifying the `getValue()` method to correctly return the value of the attribute.
