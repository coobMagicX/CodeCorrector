Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the case-insensitive behavior of the `hasClass` method. The test cases are checking if the method correctly identifies whether an element has a given class name, regardless of the case of the class name.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should focus on ensuring that the `hasClass` method correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons. This can be achieved by modifying the existing implementation to compare the class name and attribute using a case-insensitive method, such as `equalsIgnoreCase`.
