Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to check the behavior of the code when applying various comparison operators to an empty node set or a non-existent node.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling the case when the node set is empty or the specified node does not exist. This can be done by adding a check for empty node sets or non-existent nodes before performing the comparison operations.
