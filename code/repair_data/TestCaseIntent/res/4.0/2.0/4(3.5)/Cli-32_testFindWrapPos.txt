Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the correctness of the `findWrapPos` method in the `HelpFormatter` class. The test cases check if the method correctly determines the wrap position for a given text and width.

Repair strategy: Based on the failed test cases, it seems that the `findWrapPos` method is not correctly determining the wrap position in certain scenarios. The repair direction for the source code would be to investigate and fix the logic for determining the wrap position when the text exceeds the specified width.
