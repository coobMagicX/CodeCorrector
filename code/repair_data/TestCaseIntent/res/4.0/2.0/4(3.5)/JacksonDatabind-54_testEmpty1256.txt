Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that when serializing an object of type `Issue1256Bean` using the `ObjectMapper` with `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` inclusion, the resulting JSON output should be an empty object `{}`.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would be to check the logic related to the `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` inclusion in the `buildWriter` method. Specifically, the code block under the `case NON_ABSENT` section should be reviewed to ensure that the logic correctly handles the inclusion of absent values.
