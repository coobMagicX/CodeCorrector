Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `elementSiblingIndex()` method, which is expected to return the index of the element within its siblings.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the failing test cases is to fix the `indexInList()` method, which is not returning the correct index for elements with the same content.
