Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the usage message is printed correctly when an option with an empty argument name is required.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this code is to handle the case when the argument name of an option is empty in the `appendOption` method. Currently, it does not handle this case correctly, resulting in the incorrect usage message. The code should be modified to handle this scenario properly.
