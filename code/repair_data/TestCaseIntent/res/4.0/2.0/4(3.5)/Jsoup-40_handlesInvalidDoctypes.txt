Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to ensure that the DocumentType constructor can handle invalid doctypes correctly.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should include handling the case where the doctype is empty or contains invalid characters. The code should not throw an exception and should create a valid DocumentType object.
