Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `parseOctal` method when invalid inputs are provided. This includes cases where the byte array is empty, has only one byte, does not contain all NULs, contains an invalid character, does not have a trailer, and has an embedded space or NUL.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to handle these invalid inputs and throw the `IllegalArgumentException` when necessary. The repair strategy would involve adding appropriate checks and conditions to validate the inputs and throw the exception if the inputs are not valid.
