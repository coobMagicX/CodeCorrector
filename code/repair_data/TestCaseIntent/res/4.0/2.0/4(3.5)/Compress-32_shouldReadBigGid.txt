Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the "getLongGroupId()" method of the TarArchiveEntry class returns the correct value for a large group ID.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly support reading and setting large group IDs. Currently, the code uses the "setGroupId()" method, which only accepts an integer value. To support larger group IDs, the code should be updated to use the "setLongGroupId()" method instead. Additionally, the "getLongGroupId()" method should be implemented properly to return the correct value for large group IDs.
