Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the deserialization of JSON data into a CallRecord object using the ObjectMapper's reader. The test cases specifically aim to verify the behavior when encountering unknown type IDs in the JSON data.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the source code to handle unknown type IDs in the JSON data. This can be done by implementing a custom deserializer for the CallRecord class that handles the unknown type IDs gracefully, rather than skipping the children as in the current implementation.
