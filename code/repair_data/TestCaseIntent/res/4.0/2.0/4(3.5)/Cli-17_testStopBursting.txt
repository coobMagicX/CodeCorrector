Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to confirm that when the "stopAtNonOption" parameter is set to true, the method stops bursting the token and processes the remaining part of the token as a non-option argument.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should be to modify the burstToken() method to correctly handle the "stopAtNonOption" parameter. The method should stop bursting the token and process the remaining part of the token as a non-option argument when "stopAtNonOption" is true.
