Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the correct parsing of dates in ISO8601 format with partial milliseconds.

Repair strategy: The source code is failing to parse the input dates correctly, resulting in incorrect values for the hour, minute, and millisecond fields of the Calendar object. The repair direction should focus on fixing the parsing logic to correctly handle the partial milliseconds in the input date strings.
