Intent: The intent of the test case is to deserialize a JSON string into a List of AnimalAndType objects using an ObjectMapper.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would be to ensure that the deserialization is successful and the List is not null. This could involve checking the ObjectMapper configuration and the correctness of the TypeReference used for deserialization.
