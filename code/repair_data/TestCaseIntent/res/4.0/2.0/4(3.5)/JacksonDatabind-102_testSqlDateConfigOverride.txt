Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the serialized output of a java.sql.Date object matches the expected format when a custom format override is applied.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the `createContextual` method to handle the custom format override for `java.sql.Date` objects. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the handled type is `java.sql.Date` and if a custom format override is present, use it to set the format for serialization.
