Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test if the `getOptionValue` method of the `CommandLine` object returns the expected value for a long option with an equal sign and a single dash.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to modify the `flatten` method to correctly handle long options with an equal sign and a single dash. This could involve updating the logic to correctly identify and extract the option value in this format.
