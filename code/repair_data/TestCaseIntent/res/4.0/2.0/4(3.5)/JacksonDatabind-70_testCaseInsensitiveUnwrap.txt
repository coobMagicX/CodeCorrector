Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the ObjectMapper can correctly unwrap a JSON object into a Person instance, even when the JSON properties are specified in a case-insensitive manner.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve updating the source code to support case-insensitive property matching during the unwrapping process.
