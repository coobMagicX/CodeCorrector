Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify that the `toCanonical()` method of the `JavaType` class returns the correct canonical name for the given type. The test cases check various scenarios, including generic types, raw types, and custom types.

Repair strategy: The code appears to be failing in constructing the canonical name for generic types. The repair strategy would involve fixing the implementation of the `toCanonical()` method to properly handle generic types and their type parameters.
