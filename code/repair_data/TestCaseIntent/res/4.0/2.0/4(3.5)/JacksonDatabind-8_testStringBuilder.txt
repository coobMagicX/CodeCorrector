Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the `readValue` method of the `MAPPER` object successfully deserializes a JSON string into a `StringBuilder` object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the deserialization process of the `readValue` method to correctly convert the JSON string into a `StringBuilder` object.
