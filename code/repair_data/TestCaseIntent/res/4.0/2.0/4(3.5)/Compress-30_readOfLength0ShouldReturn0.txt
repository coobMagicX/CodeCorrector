Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that when reading 0 bytes from the input stream, the method returns 0.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should be to modify the source code to handle the case when the length parameter is 0. Currently, the code does not handle this case properly, resulting in a failing test case.
