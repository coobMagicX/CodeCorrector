Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the serialization of a custom object (Data) using Jackson's ObjectMapper. The test cases check if the serialized output matches the expected JSON string.

Repair strategy: Based on the failed test case, it appears that the custom serialization logic is not working as expected. The repair direction would involve investigating the serialization code for the "Data" class and ensuring that it correctly serializes the "aStr" field as "The value is: Hello!".
