Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to check the deserialization behavior of the ObjectMapper for an empty JSON object. The test is expecting the ObjectMapper to deserialize the JSON string into an instance of the MyValue class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue is to modify the source code to handle the deserialization of empty JSON objects correctly. The code should check if the JSON token is an empty object and return an appropriate result.
