Intent: The intent and purpose of the failed test case is to test the behavior of compressing multiple files, where at least some of the files are not empty.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this code can involve checking if the length of the BitSet is greater than 0 before writing the cache to the header. This will prevent writing an empty cache if the length is 0.
