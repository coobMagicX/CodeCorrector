Intent: The purpose of the test case is to verify the correctness of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `Element` class. The test case checks whether two elements are equal and have the same hash code.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the `equals` method in the `Element` class to properly compare the elements based on their attributes and content. Additionally, the `hashCode` method should be updated to generate hash codes that are consistent with the updated `equals` method.
