Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify the behavior of the source code when the time value exceeds the limit of a signed 32-bit integer.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling the case when the time value is too big for a 32-bit integer. The code should be modified to handle this scenario gracefully, such as by throwing a specific exception or returning an error code.
