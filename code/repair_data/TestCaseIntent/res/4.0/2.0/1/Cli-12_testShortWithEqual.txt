Intent: The intent of the test case `testShortWithEqual` is to confirm that the command-line parser correctly handles short options with arguments provided in the format `-f=bar`, where `-f` is the short option and `bar` is its argument.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `flatten` method correctly parses and separates the option `-f` from its value `bar` when they are combined in the format `-f=bar`. This entails modifying the code segment that deals with options prefixed with a hyphen to split the argument at the equal sign and separately add the option and its value to the token list. This involves checking if the argument contains an equal sign and, if so, splitting it appropriately before adding the elements to the tokens list. This will ensure that the parser recognizes `-f` as an option with the value `bar` instead of treating `-f=bar` as a single unrecognized option.
