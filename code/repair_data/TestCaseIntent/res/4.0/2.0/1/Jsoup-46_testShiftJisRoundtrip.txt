Intent: The test case `testShiftJisRoundtrip` is intended to verify that HTML content, when parsed and serialized using the Shift_JIS encoding, does not introduce unexpected characters (like '?') and correctly handles HTML entities such as non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;` or `&#xa0;`). It aims to confirm that the escaping and encoding operations preserve the original content fidelity, especially when dealing with special or non-ASCII characters.

Repair strategy: Inspect the encoding handling logic in the `escape` function, particularly how non-ASCII characters are encoded and escaped. Ensure that the function respects the specified character encoding (Shift_JIS in this case) without fallback to replacement characters (like '?'). A specific area to focus on could be the `canEncode` method used within the escaping logic, verifying that it accurately checks the encodability of characters in the specified charset. This might involve adjusting the encoding capabilities check or handling specific cases for characters that are known to cause issues in certain encodings like Shift_JIS. If `canEncode` returns false for characters that should be supported, it could lead to incorrect escaping, resulting in '?' appearing in the output.
