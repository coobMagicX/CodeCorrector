Intent: The test case `testStop3` is intended to verify that the method `flatten` correctly parses command line arguments into options and non-option arguments when the `stopAtNonOption` flag is set to true. It specifically checks that options not defined in the command line are not mistakenly set as active and that all arguments after a non-option argument are treated as non-option arguments.

Repair strategy: The current implementation might be incorrectly handling or misinterpreting options, particularly those with special characters or equals signs, and might not properly handle the `stopAtNonOption` behavior. To remedy the source code:
1. Ensure that double equals signs in options (e.g., `--zop==1`) are handled correctly, perhaps by adjusting the logic that splits on the first equals sign.
2. Review and correct the logic in `processOptionToken` and `burstToken` methods to make sure they respect the `stopAtNonOption` flag.
3. Verify and possibly adjust the conditions that determine when to stop processing further options and start adding remaining tokens to the list of non-option arguments. Ensure that after encountering a non-option argument when `stopAtNonOption` is true, all subsequent tokens are treated as non-option arguments.
