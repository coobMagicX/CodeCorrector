Intent: The purpose of the test case `testDisappearingMixins515` is to verify that the mixin annotations applied to a `Person` class through `PersonMixin` are correctly utilized during serialization, such that the resultant JSON string accurately represents the intended fields of an instance of `PersonImpl` (presumably influenced by the mixin).

Repair strategy: The failure of the test case suggests that the mixin methods might not be correctly overriding or augmenting the methods of `PersonImpl`, leading to incorrect serialization output. The source code should be inspected for how mixin methods are handled, especially looking at how `_addMethodMixIns` and related method handling features such as `_addMixUnders` and `_constructMethod`. The following steps can be considered:
1. Review `_addMethodMixIns` to ensure that it correctly identifies and integrates mixin methods, especially checking if method precedence and visibility are handled correctly.
2. Ensure that mixin methods that should override or augment target class methods are not being ignored due to incorrect conditional logic or method visibility checks.
3. Check the implementation of `_isIncludableMemberMethod` to verify that it correctly filters methods which should be included from the mixin class.
4. Probe into how `AnnotatedMethodMap` manages the addition and retrieval of methods, particularly focusing on conditions where a method from the mixin class should supersede or augment the existing methods in the target class.
5. Test the serialization behavior with different configurations of mixin and target classes to isolate the condition causing the incorrect serialization output.
