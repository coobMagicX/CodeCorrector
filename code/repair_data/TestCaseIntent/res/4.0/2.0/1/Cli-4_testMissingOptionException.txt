Intent: The test case `testMissingOptionException()` is designed to verify that the `MissingOptionException` is thrown when a required option (in this case, 'f') is not provided in the input arguments. The test also checks that the exception message specifically identifies the missing required option by name.

Repair strategy: The `checkRequiredOptions()` method in the source code should be adjusted to format the exception message to include a clear and user-friendly message indicating which specific options are missing. Currently, the method generates a concatenated string of missing options without any descriptive text or formatting. Modify the `checkRequiredOptions()` method to prepend a descriptive message to the buffer such as "Missing required option: " before listing the missing options, and ensure it handles formatting correctly when multiple options are missing. Additionally, assess and possibly revise how multiple missing options are concatenated to ensure clarity in the error message.
