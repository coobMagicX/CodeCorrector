Intent: The intent of the test `testYahooArticle` is to parse an HTML document containing a Yahoo news article and verify if the text extracted from a specific paragraph element matches the expected string. This test ensures that the HTML parsing and text extraction functionalities are working correctly.

Repair strategy: Given that the failure is happening during the parsing of the document, it would be prudent to investigate how special characters and HTML entities are being handled during the parsing process. Specifically, the `unescape` function should be reviewed to ensure it correctly translates all HTML entities to their respective characters without errors, particularly for edge cases and less common entities. The condition `if (charval != -1 || charval > 0xFFFF)` in the `unescape` function appears to be logically incorrect as it should use `&&` instead of `||` to ensure both conditions must be true. This could lead to incorrect parsing or character replacement in strings, affecting the document's text content as extracted by Jsoup.
