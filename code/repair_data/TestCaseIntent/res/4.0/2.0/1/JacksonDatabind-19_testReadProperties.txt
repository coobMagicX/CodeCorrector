Intent: The intent of the test case `testReadProperties` is to validate that a JSON string containing various key-value pairs can be parsed correctly into a `Properties` object using a JSON mapper. The test checks if the JSON values are accurately converted and stored as string representations, regardless of the original data type in the JSON (e.g., integer, boolean).

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that all types of values (not just strings) within a JSON map are converted to their string representations when mapped to a `Properties` object. This might involve modifying the `_mapType` function or the relevant JSON parsing logic to handle different data types explicitly and convert them to string values before setting them in the `Properties` object. This could be done by either adjusting the type conversion process within the `MapType.construct` method or ensuring that the `findTypeParameters` method appropriately handles `Properties.class` to always return string type parameters for keys and values.
