Intent: The test case `testInverseExternalId928` is designed to validate the deserialization process of JSON data into Java objects using the Jackson library, where the JSON structure contains external type identifiers that determine the actual type of the object being deserialized. The test specifically checks that the order of JSON fields (`class` and `payload`) does not affect the successful deserialization of `Envelope928` objects, ensuring the robustness and flexibility of the deserialization process.

Repair strategy: The source code likely fails due to the handling of external type identifiers when they appear before the actual data payload. This suggests an issue in the `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithExternalTypeId` method where it may not correctly buffer or utilize the external type identifier when it precedes the payload. To repair this, modify the method to ensure that the presence of type identifiers at any position is correctly linked to the subsequent payload processing. This could involve adjusting how properties are buffered and ensuring the type information is retained and correctly associated with the payload when the external type identifier (`class` field in this case) is encountered before the actual data (`payload` field). This might also require ensuring that the `ExternalTypeHandler` is effectively managing state across different orders of JSON fields.
