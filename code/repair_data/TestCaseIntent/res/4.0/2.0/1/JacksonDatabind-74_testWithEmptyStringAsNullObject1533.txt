Intent: The test case `testWithEmptyStringAsNullObject1533` is designed to verify that when the `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` is enabled, an empty string in the JSON input is deserialized as a `null` object. This behavior is expected to be handled correctly by the custom deserializer code.

Repair strategy: The current deserializer implementation appears not to consider the scenario where an empty string should be treated as a null object based on the deserialization feature settings. A possible repair direction would be to modify the `_deserializeTypedUsingDefaultImpl` method to explicitly check for empty strings when the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature is enabled. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the current token is a string and its value is empty, then returning null if the feature is enabled. This ensures that when encountering an empty string in the JSON, the method respects the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` setting and correctly returns a null instead of attempting to deserialize the empty string as an object.
