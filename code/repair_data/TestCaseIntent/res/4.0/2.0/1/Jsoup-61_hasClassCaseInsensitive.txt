Intent: The intent of the test case `hasClassCaseInsensitive` is to verify that the `hasClass` method correctly identifies class names in a case-insensitive manner across different HTML elements, each with different cases in their class attribute values.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the method `hasClass` properly accesses and handles the case insensitivity when comparing class names in the HTML elements. The leading cause of the failure appears to be related to how the `attributes` map is accessed or how it handles case differences in attribute keys. Since HTML attributes are case-insensitive, the method should effectively normalize the case before fetching and comparing the class names. The repair should involve:
- Ensuring that `attributes.get("class")` fetches the class attribute irrespective of its case in the HTML document.
- Adding a check or normalization step to handle different cases in attribute keys, possibly converting all keys to lower case upon loading them into the attributes map or using a case-insensitive retrieval method.
