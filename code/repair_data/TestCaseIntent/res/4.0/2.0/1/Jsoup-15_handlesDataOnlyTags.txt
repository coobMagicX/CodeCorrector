Intent: The test case `handlesDataOnlyTags` is intended to verify that elements typically used to contain data (like `<style>` and `<script>`) correctly store and distinguish between content that should be treated as data and content that should be treated as visible text. The test ensures that content within `<style>` and `<script>` tags is recognized as data and does not contribute to the visible text of the document, while content within `<p>` tags is treated as visible text.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the parser correctly differentiates between data-containing tags and text-containing tags during the HTML parsing and DOM construction process. This may involve adjusting the handling of text nodes and data nodes in the parsing logic to maintain a clear distinction between data (e.g., JavaScript code or CSS) and visible text content. Check and possibly revise the parsing conditions or state transitions in the parser when encountering `<style>` and `<script>` tags to ensure they do not mistakenly contribute to the text output of the parser.
