Intent: The intent of the test case `testElementSiblingIndexSameContent` is to verify that the `elementSiblingIndex()` method correctly returns the zero-based index of each `<p>` element within its parent `<div>`, even when the elements have identical content.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the implementation of the `elementSiblingIndex()` method or the way elements are compared within the `indexInList` function. The repair should focus on ensuring that the comparison between elements respects their positions rather than just their content or attributes. This might involve modifying the `equals` method used in `indexInList` or revising how sibling indices are determined, potentially by using the identity of elements (`==`) instead of equality (`equals`), or by tracking original insertion order in the collection.
