Intent: The test case "handlesUnclosedAnchors" aims to verify that the HTML parser correctly handles the situation where an anchor tag is opened but not properly closed before a new block element (`<p>` tag) starts. It checks if the parser automatically closes the unclosed anchor tag when a new block element begins, and then reopens a new anchor tag within the block element for the subsequent content.

Repair strategy: Ensure the HTML parser implements logic to automatically close an open anchor tag when encountering block-level elements like `<p>`, which should not be nested within an anchor. This requires adjustments in the state management of the parser, specifically in how it handles transitions between inlines (like anchors) and block-level elements. This could involve modifying the handling of the start and end tags in the parsing logic to better manage the scope and nesting of elements, ensuring tags that should not be nested are correctly closed and reopened as per HTML standards.
