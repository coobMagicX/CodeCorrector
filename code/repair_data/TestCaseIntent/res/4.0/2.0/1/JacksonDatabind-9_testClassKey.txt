Intent: The failing test case intends to serialize a map where the keys are class types (`String.class` in this case) and the values are integers. The expected output is a JSON string representing the map, with class names as keys in a string format.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle serialization of `Class<?>` type keys correctly, ensuring that the class name is used as the JSON field name. This requires checking if the `value` is an instance of `Class<?>` and then using `Class.getName()` to obtain the fully qualified name of the class as the field name. Add this condition before the existing conditions in the `serialize` method.
