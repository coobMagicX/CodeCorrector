Intent: The intent of the test case `testLongLineChunkingIndentIgnored` is to verify that the `HelpFormatter` correctly handles and formats a long command line option description by wrapping the text according to a specified width and indentation, ensuring that the indentation and line breaks are placed correctly without ignoring the specified indent settings.

Repair strategy: The problem likely lies in how the `renderWrappedText` function calculates the position to wrap the text and how it handles the indentation for subsequent lines. Specifically, the calculation of `pos` in the line where it checks `(text.length() > width) && (pos == nextLineTabStop - 1)` might be faulty or not adequately account for cases where the indentation exceeds or meets certain conditions relative to the set width. The repair should involve revising the logic that determines `pos` to ensure it properly considers the effects of `nextLineTabStop` on wrapping positions, especially in edge cases where the `nextLineTabStop` is a significant fraction of `width`. Additionally, ensuring that the loop correctly and efficiently handles the addition of padding for lines after the first and maintains the right alignment as per the test expectation without causing infinite loops or improper line breaks is crucial.
