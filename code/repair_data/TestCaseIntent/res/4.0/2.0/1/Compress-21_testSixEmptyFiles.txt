Intent: The test case `testSixEmptyFiles` likely aims to validate the functionality of the `writeBits` method when writing a series of empty files represented by bits. The specific test may be checking the method's ability to handle and correctly write an empty or minimal BitSet (with zero bits set) in repeated instances (six times).

Repair strategy: The test failure suggests potential issues with how the `writeBits` method handles cases where the BitSet `length` is zero or minimal. The method should correctly handle cases where no bits are present or need to be written. The main areas for repair include:
1. Ensuring that the method does not attempt to write any data when the length of the BitSet is zero, as this suggests there are no bits to write.
2. Verify and potentially fix the condition that checks whether to write the `cache` to the `header` when `length` is greater than 0 but less than 8 (since `shift` would not reach 0 in initial iterations for very short lengths).
3. Add a specific condition or return early from the method if the `length` parameter is zero to prevent unnecessary processing or incorrect writes.
