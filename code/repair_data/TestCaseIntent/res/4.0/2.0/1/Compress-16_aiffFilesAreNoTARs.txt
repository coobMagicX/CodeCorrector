Intent: The test case 'aiffFilesAreNoTARs' is designed to verify that the method `createArchiveInputStream` correctly identifies when a given InputStream does not correspond to any supported archive format, particularly ensuring that an AIFF audio file is not mistakenly recognized as an archive file. The test ensures that an `ArchiveException` with a specific message "No Archiver found" is thrown when attempting to process a non-archive file.

Repair strategy: Check the logic inside the `createArchiveInputStream` method to ensure that it accurately detects non-archive files and returns the appropriate exception. This could involve refining the signature matching logic for archive formats or ensuring that the method does not incorrectly trigger conditions meant for archive files when handling non-archive inputs. Additionally, ensure that all file format checks (like dump and tar) are correctly implemented and do not erroneously recognize non-archive files as valid archives.
