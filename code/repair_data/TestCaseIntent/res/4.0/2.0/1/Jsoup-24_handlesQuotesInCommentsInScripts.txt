Intent: The test case "handlesQuotesInCommentsInScripts" is intended to verify that the parser correctly handles JavaScript code within HTML comments in a `<script>` tag, specifically ensuring that it correctly interprets concatenated string literals that could be misinterpreted as closing script tags.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the parser's handling of string literals within script tags and comments to ensure that they are not incorrectly processed as ending tags or other HTML elements. This may involve improving the logic that determines when the parser is within a script element and how it handles different characters and sequences within that context. The parsing logic should be capable of distinguishing between actual HTML tag delimiters and similar sequences within script strings or comments.
