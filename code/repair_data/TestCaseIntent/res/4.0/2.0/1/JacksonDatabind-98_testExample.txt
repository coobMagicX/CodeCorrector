Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to serialize a list of `AnimalAndType` objects to JSON and then deserialize it back to ensure the integrity and correctness of the serialization and deserialization processes.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure the proper handling of type information during serialization and deserialization. This includes checking if the custom deserializer (`complete` method) properly handles the type identifiers and associated properties for the `AnimalAndType` objects. Ensure that type metadata is correctly utilized and that any necessary configurations for handling polymorphic types are correctly set up in the ObjectMapper. Consider verifying or adding annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` on the `AnimalAndType` class or related classes to aid in the proper type resolution during the deserialization process.
