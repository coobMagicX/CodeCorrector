Intent: The test case `testEscapeBackslash1` intends to verify that the backslash character (`\`) is printed correctly without any modifications or escaping in the output when the CSV format is set to use a specific quote character (`QUOTE_CH`).

Repair strategy: Analyze the implementation of the `printAndQuote` method to ensure that it does not incorrectly handle or modify the backslash character when determining quote necessity or during output generation. Ensure that characters like the backslash (`\`) are treated as normal characters unless specific escaping rules are set. If the backslash is being escaped or modified, adjust the code in the `printAndQuote` method to correctly handle cases where no escaping should occur based on the configuration of the CSV format, particularly when not required by the quote mode policy. This may require adjusting the condition checks in the `MINIMAL` case of the quote mode switch statement to ensure it doesn't inadvertently trigger quoting or escaping when not necessary.
