Intent: The purpose of the test case `testSingleOptionSingleArgument` is to verify that the function `getValues` correctly retrieves the values associated with a specific option from the command line arguments. If the option is not found or has no values, the function should correctly apply default values.

Repair strategy: The source code must be modified to ensure that if specific command line arguments are provided (like "-b 1" in the test), the function `getValues` not only fetches the given value ("1" in this case) but also correctly appends the additional default values ("1000" as specified in the test setup) to the resultant list. This might involve checking and modifying the logic where the function checks for the presence of values and how it handles the merging of command line values with default values. Ensure that the function can differentiate between values explicitly provided via command line and those that need to be added from default values.
