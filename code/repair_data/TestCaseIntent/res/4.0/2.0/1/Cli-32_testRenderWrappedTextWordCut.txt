Intent: The intent of the test case `testRenderWrappedTextWordCut` is to verify if the `HelpFormatter` class can correctly wrap a single long word at a specified width, even when no whitespace or breaks exist to naturally split the word. The expectation is that the text will be cut off at the specified width and continue on a new line.

Repair strategy: The code should handle cases where there are no natural break points (spaces, tabs, or newline characters) within the text and still needs to wrap text at the specified width. The current implementation seems to overlook scenarios where a word needs to be split without any whitespace. The repair should include modifying the `findWrapPos` method to better handle word cutting by ensuring it does not overrun the text's length and correctly identifies positions to insert breaks when no whitespace characters are present. Specifically, check and adjust the logic within both the `while` loops in the `findWrapPos` method to correctly manage indices and conditions for breaking long words. Adjust the second loop to ensure it stops at text boundaries and properly handles cases where no natural breaks exist.
