Intent: The intent of the test case `handlesLTinScript` is to verify that the Jsoup library correctly handles less than (<) characters within script tags when parsing HTML content as XML. Specifically, it tests the conversion of pseudo XML declarations within JavaScript strings to comments, in line with XML parsing rules.

Repair strategy: Modify the XML parsing logic in the Jsoup library to better distinguish between actual XML declarations and similar patterns within script tags that are not meant to be treated as XML declarations. This could involve enhancing the parsing rules or adding specific checks to identify and appropriately handle cases where pseudo XML declarations appear within script elements, ensuring they are not mistakenly converted to comments during XML parsing.
