Intent: The purpose of the test cases is to verify the correct type handling and warnings produced by assigning different values to the `prototype` property of an object in JavaScript. Specifically, it tests the assignment of strings, objects, and functions to `prototype` and checks if the system correctly identifies type mismatches and does not issue unnecessary warnings for inferred types.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle and differentiate the type expectations when assigning various types to the `prototype` property. This includes:
1. Adjusting the logic in the `isQualifiedNameInferred` method to accurately determine when an assignment should be considered as inferred based on the type and context of the assignment.
2. Ensuring that type checks and warnings are correctly issued based on the actual type of the value assigned to `prototype` versus the expected type declaration in JSDoc comments.
3. Reviewing how the function `isFunctionTypeDeclaration` and the checks for `isUnknownType` handle different type assignments to `prototype`, to prevent incorrect inference outcomes.
4. Enhancing the handling of scope and the detection of conditional or inner scope assignments, as these influence whether an assignment should be inferred or not.
