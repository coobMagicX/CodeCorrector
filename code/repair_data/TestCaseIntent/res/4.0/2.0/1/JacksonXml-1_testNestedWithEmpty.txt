Intent: The test case is designed to ensure that the XML parser correctly interprets an XML structure with nested elements, even when some of these nested elements are empty. The specific check is that an empty `<VehicleMonitoringDelivery>` element within the `<ServiceDelivery>` root should result in the creation of an object (with a size indicating one entry, presumably empty or default) rather than being ignored or leading to a null or empty representation.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle cases where empty XML elements, which are supposed to be converted into objects, are treated as valid objects with default values rather than being skipped or nullified. This likely involves modifying the handling logic in the XML_TEXT case of the switch statement, particularly where the `_isEmpty(_currText)` check leads to different handling for array contexts. The logic should ensure that an empty XML element in the context of a nested object structure still results in the creation of a corresponding object structure in the JSON output, which would be interpreted by the mapping function to populate the `ServiceDelivery` class appropriately. Adjustments may also need to be made in the handling of `XML_END_ELEMENT` to ensure that objects are correctly closed and registered even if they contain no text or sub-elements.
