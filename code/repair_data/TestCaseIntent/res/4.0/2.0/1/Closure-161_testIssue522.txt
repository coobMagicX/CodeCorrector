Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testIssue522` is to verify that the method `tryFoldArrayAccess` correctly handles the scenario where an array access on an empty array (`[][1] = 1;`) is attempted. The test seems to aim at ensuring that no improper folding or errors occur when setting a value in an empty array, which should inherently be an out-of-bounds operation.

Repair strategy: The method `tryFoldArrayAccess` should be modified to handle cases where the left-hand side (the array itself) is empty and does not contain any elements. Currently, the code does not specifically check if the array is empty before proceeding to access its elements. A potential repair could involve adding a check to see if the left node (`left`) is an empty array before attempting to access or modify its contents. If the array is empty, the method should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning the original node without modification or by generating an appropriate error message. This would prevent the out-of-bounds access and align the function's behavior with the expectations set by the test case.
