Intent: The test case `preSkipsFirstNewline` is intended to verify that the HTML parser correctly handles the first newline character inside a `<pre>` tag by skipping it, which is standard behavior for `<pre>` tags. It also checks that subsequent newline characters are preserved in the `wholeText` output.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the parser or relevant method handling the `<pre>` tag content correctly skips the very first newline character immediately following the opening `<pre>` tag, while retaining all subsequent text and newline characters untouched. This might involve adjusting the logic in the tokenization or parsing phases where `<pre>` tags are specifically handled. Adjustments should be made so that the initial newline character inside `<pre>` tags is not included in the output of `wholeText()`, aligning it with the behavior expected by the test case.
