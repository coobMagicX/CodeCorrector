Intent: The purpose of the test case `shortTextFilesAreNoTARs` is to validate that the method `createArchiveInputStream` does not mistakenly identify a non-archive text input as a TAR archive or any other type of archive. The test ensures that when the input data does not match any known archive signatures, the method should throw an `ArchiveException` with a specific message indicating that no appropriate archiver was found for the stream signature.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly adjust the logic in `createArchiveInputStream` method that checks for archive signatures, especially focusing on handling cases where the input stream is too short or does not match any expected archive format signatures. Ensure that the method correctly identifies non-archive streams and throws the appropriate exception. Also, verify and ensure that the TAR signature checking logic does not incorrectly accept input as a TAR archive when it is not, possibly by refining the conditions under which `TarArchiveInputStream` is considered a match.
