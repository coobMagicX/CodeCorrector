Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testToMapWithNoHeader()` is to ensure that calling `toMap()` on a `CSVRecord` instance with no header row returns an empty map. This test is designed to check the functionality when CSV data does not include header fields that might normally be used to key the map.

Repair strategy: The source code provided does not directly relate to the operation being tested (i.e., `shortRec.toMap()`). The issue appears to be with the `CSVRecord.toMap()` method rather than the `putIn()` method provided. To repair the code based on the failed test case:
1. Ensure that the `CSVRecord.toMap()` method is designed to return an empty map when there are no headers in the CSV data. This might involve checking if the header metadata is null or empty before populating the map.
2. Modify the `CSVRecord.toMap()` method to handle cases where no headers are present by either returning an empty map immediately or by setting a flag that prevents key-value mapping when headers are absent.
3. Add appropriate error handling or conditional checks within `CSVRecord.toMap()` to manage scenarios of missing headers gracefully, ensuring that no keys are created without headers, thus returning an empty map as expected by the test.
