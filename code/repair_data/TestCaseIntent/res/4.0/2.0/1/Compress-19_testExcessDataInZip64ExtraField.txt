Intent: The intent of the test case `testExcessDataInZip64ExtraField` is to verify that the `ZipFile` class can correctly handle a ZIP archive entry when the Zip64 extra field contains additional, unexpected data beyond the expected fields for uncompressed size, compressed size, relative header offset, and disk start number.

Repair strategy: To address the test failure, the source code should be modified to ensure robust handling of excess data in the Zip64 extra field. This could involve adjusting the logic in the `reparseCentralDirectoryData` method to not strictly enforce that the length of the raw central directory data matches exactly with the expected length when additional data may be present. The method should be tolerant to additional unaccounted bytes after parsing the required fields, potentially by only verifying that the length is at least the minimum required based on the present flags (`hasUncompressedSize`, `hasCompressedSize`, `hasRelativeHeaderOffset`, `hasDiskStart`), rather than an exact match.
