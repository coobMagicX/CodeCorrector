Intent:
The intent of the test case `constructorValidationOkWithBlankName` is to verify that the `DocumentType` constructor does not throw an exception when passed empty strings for its parameters (`name`, `publicId`, `systemId`, `baseUri`). This test seems to aim at assessing the constructor's robustness or compatibility with minimal input.

Repair strategy:
Given that the test fails specifically due to the `Validate.notEmpty(name);` check in the constructor (which ensures that `name` is not empty), the repair strategy would involve reconsidering the validation logic. If the intent is to allow empty strings for `name`, then the validation logic should be adjusted or removed. If the intent is indeed to disallow blank names, then the test case itself should be modified to align with this requirement, possibly testing instead that the correct exception is thrown when a blank name is provided.
