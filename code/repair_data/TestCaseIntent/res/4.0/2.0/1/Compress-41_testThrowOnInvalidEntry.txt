Intent: The test case `testThrowOnInvalidEntry` is intended to verify that the method `getNextZipEntry` correctly identifies and throws an exception when it encounters an invalid entry in a zip file. This is to ensure the robustness of the zip processing, specifically that it can handle corrupted or malformed zip archives appropriately by signaling an error.

Repair strategy: The repair should involve modifying the `getNextZipEntry` method to throw a `ZipException` when it encounters an unexpected or invalid signature instead of returning null or failing silently. This involves checking the signature of each zip entry and comparing it against expected values (e.g., `LFH_SIG`, `CFH_SIG`, `AED_SIG`). If the signature does not match any expected value, the method should throw a `ZipException` with a message indicating the nature of the error, such as "Unexpected record signature". This will make the method's behavior align with the test's expectations and improve error handling in the system.
