Intent: The intent of the test case `testMapToProperties` is to ensure that the custom mapper correctly converts a bean object into a `Properties` class, handling the type conversion of non-string properties to string properties as required by the `Properties` class.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to include or improve the type coercion mechanism within the mapping process, especially for converting non-string types (like integers) to strings when mapping to a `Properties` object. This could involve adjusting the `_mapType` method or related serialization/deserialization settings to ensure that all values are stored as strings in the `Properties` object. Additionally, ensure that the mapping configuration adheres to the special requirements of the `Properties` class, which expects keys and values to be strings.
