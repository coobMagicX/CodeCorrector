Intent: The test case `testNestedUnwrappedLists180` is intended to verify the correct deserialization of XML data into Java objects, even when dealing with nested structures such as lists within lists and empty elements. The test aims to confirm that the parser handles empty XML elements (in this case, `<records></records>`) correctly and can populate nested Java objects accordingly, ensuring that no data is lost or incorrectly initialized as null where it shouldn't be.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to ensure that empty XML elements are correctly handled, especially in the context of arrays and nested lists. The particular focus should be on the handling of XML elements that represent empty lists in the input XML, ensuring these are not interpreted as `null` but instead as empty collections. This will involve modifying the parsing logic to differentiate between truly empty nodes and structurally significant but content-empty nodes, such as empty lists. Additionally, checks for empty text content should be refined to prevent incorrect skipping or misinterpretation of subsequent XML elements that are crucial for maintaining the correct structure and content of the resulting Java objects.
