Intent: The test case `testParseOctalInvalid` is designed to verify that the `parseOctal` method correctly handles various invalid input cases. The intent is to ensure the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when faced with empty byte arrays, improperly formatted octal strings, and octal strings with incorrect trailing characters.

Repair strategy:
1. Implement validation checks to ensure the input buffer has a minimum required length to be considered a valid octal string.
2. Enhance the method to more robustly handle edge cases, such as embedded spaces or NUL characters within the octal digits, ensuring these lead to an `IllegalArgumentException`.
3. Introduce a check for the proper termination of the octal string, ensuring it ends with a space or NUL character as expected in a well-formed octal input.
4. Adjust the initial parsing logic to more accurately differentiate between padding (leading zeros and spaces) and the actual octal number, ensuring that unexpected characters or sequence patterns trigger the appropriate exceptions. 

By addressing these issues, the method will more accurately validate and parse the input data, aligning with the test cases' expectations and handling a broader range of invalid inputs.
