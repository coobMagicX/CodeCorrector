Intent:
The intent of the test case `testGetLineNumberWithCR` is to validate that the `CSVParser` correctly increments the line number when encountering a carriage return (`\r`) character, which is set as the line separator in the CSV format. This is important for accurately tracking the number of lines processed in CSV files that use `\r` as a line separator.

Repair strategy:
The repair should involve modifying the `read()` method to properly increment the `lineCounter` when a `\r` character is encountered. The current implementation only increments the counter for newline (`\n`) characters. The source code should be adjusted to also check for carriage return (`\r`) characters and increment the line counter accordingly. This ensures that the parser correctly handles different types of line endings, particularly those specified in the CSV format settings.
