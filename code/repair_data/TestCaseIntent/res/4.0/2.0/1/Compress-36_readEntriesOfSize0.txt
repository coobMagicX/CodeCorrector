Intent:
The intent of the test case `readEntriesOfSize0()` is to validate the behavior of the `SevenZFile` class when reading entries from a 7z archive where certain files ("2.txt" and "5.txt") are expected to be of size 0. The test ensures that the method correctly returns -1 (indicating end-of-file) for these empty files, while other files should contain data (not return -1). It also checks if the total number of entries read matches the expected count.

Repair strategy:
The likely issue suggested by the failed test case involves incorrect handling of empty files or the stream not being properly positioned or reset upon reading new entries. The repair should focus on:
1. Ensuring that the `getCurrentStream()` method correctly handles the transition between different entries in the archive, particularly when dealing with empty files. This may involve checking if the stream correctly identifies and handles empty streams or if there's an issue with the stream not being reset when calling `getNextEntry()`.
2. Reviewing the stream management logic within the `getCurrentStream()` method to confirm whether streams corresponding to empty files are correctly identified and handled, potentially by modifying the method to properly detect and return a valid end-of-file indication for empty files.
3. Testing the integration and interaction between `SevenZFile.read()` and `getCurrentStream()` to ensure that they work cohesively to handle file entries of varying sizes, including those with zero length.
