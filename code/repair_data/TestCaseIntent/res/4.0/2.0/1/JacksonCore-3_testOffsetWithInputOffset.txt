Intent: The purpose of the `testOffsetWithInputOffset` test case is to verify the correct handling of byte offsets when parsing a JSON input that includes deliberately placed offset padding. The test aims to ensure that the parser correctly handles and reports the location of tokens and current parser positions within the JSON document, accounting for the offsets introduced by the padding bytes.

Repair strategy: Examine and adjust the handling of byte offsets within the `UTF8StreamJsonParser` constructor or potentially within the methods that manage the byte offset calculations (`getTokenLocation` and `getCurrentLocation`). The repair should ensure that the offset calculations account for any initial padding specified by the start parameter in the parser construction, aligning the reported byte offsets with the expectations set in the test case. Specifically, the byte offset logic needs to correctly interpret the offset introduced by the start parameter to reflect the correct position in the JSON input, ignoring any preceding padding bytes.
