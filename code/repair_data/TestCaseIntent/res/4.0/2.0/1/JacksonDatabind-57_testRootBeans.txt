Intent: The intent of the test case `testRootBeans()` is to verify that the method `readValues()` can correctly parse and create Java objects (beans) from various sources of JSON input data, ensuring that the JSON is properly detected, parsed, and bound to Java objects across different data formats.

Repair strategy: The potential issue in the `readValues()` method could be related to its handling of different data formats and the creation of the parser. To repair the source code:
1. Ensure that the method `_detectBindAndReadValues()` correctly identifies and processes the data format for each type of source input provided in the tests.
2. Verify and possibly enhance the implementation of `_dataFormatReaders.findFormat()` to accurately detect the format of input JSON data from different sources.
3. Check and debug the parser creation in `_parserFactory.createParser(src)` to ensure it can handle various offsets and lengths correctly, parsing the JSON without errors.
4. Review any filtering logic in `_considerFilter()` to confirm it does not alter the data in a way that would cause the beans to be misconfigured or incorrectly instantiated.
