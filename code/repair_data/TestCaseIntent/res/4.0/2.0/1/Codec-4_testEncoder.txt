Intent: The intent of the test case `testEncoder()` is to verify that the `Base64` encoder correctly encodes a series of byte arrays (`BYTES`) into their corresponding Base64 encoded strings (`STRINGS`). The test ensures that for each string in `STRINGS`, when converted to a byte array and encoded using the `Base64` class, the result matches the expected Base64 encoded byte array.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the `Base64` encoding functionality properly converts binary data into Base64 format. Check the implementation of the `encode` method in the `Base64` class to confirm that it adheres to the Base64 encoding specifications. If the encoding process is incorrect or incomplete, modify the `encode` method to correctly handle all edge cases and standard scenarios as per Base64 encoding rules. This may involve adjusting how binary data is parsed and converted into Base64 characters, ensuring padding characters are correctly added, and handling different input sizes accurately.
