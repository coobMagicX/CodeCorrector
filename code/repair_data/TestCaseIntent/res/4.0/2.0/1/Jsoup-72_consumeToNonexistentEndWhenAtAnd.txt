Intent: The intent of the test case `consumeToNonexistentEndWhenAtAnd` is to verify that the method `consumeTo` correctly handles the situation where the specified end character (`>`) does not exist in the input string. The test aims to ensure that the method returns an empty string if the end character is not found and confirms that the CharacterReader remains empty after the operation.

Repair strategy: The failure indicates that the method `consumeTo` may not be correctly handling cases where the end character is absent from the remaining input. The repair direction should involve modifying the `consumeTo` method to check if the end character is present in the input. If the end character is not found, the method should return an empty string immediately and ensure the reader's state is correctly updated to reflect that it is empty. This might involve adjusting the index or pointer management within the `CharacterReader` to correctly identify the end of the content and handle the boundary conditions properly.
