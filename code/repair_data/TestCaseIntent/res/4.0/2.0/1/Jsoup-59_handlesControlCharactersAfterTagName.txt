Intent: The test case is intended to verify the robustness of the HTML cleaning process, specifically ensuring that control characters immediately following a tag name are handled appropriately, and that they do not disrupt the parsing or sanitation process. The desired outcome is to have an HTML anchor (`<a>`) tag that conforms to a basic whitelist, which includes removing any unwanted attributes or malformed tag structures while adding default attributes such as `rel="nofollow"`.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that control characters in the tag name are correctly processed or removed during the parsing phase. This may involve:
1. Enhancing the attribute handling logic in the `newAttribute()` method to better manage and sanitize tag names and attributes that contain control characters.
2. Implementing or improving existing checks for control characters during the tag and attribute parsing stages to prevent malformed tag names from being processed as valid.
3. Ensuring that the parsing logic conforms to HTML standards in terms of handling tags with embedded control characters, possibly discarding such tags or cleaning them in a way that they do not affect the resulting document structure.
