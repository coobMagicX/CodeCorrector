Intent:
The intent of the test case `testIssue1125WithDefault` is to deserialize a JSON string into an instance of `Issue1125Wrapper` class, ensuring that the `value` field within `Issue1125Wrapper` is correctly instantiated as an object of `Default1125` class with the appropriate values for its fields (`a`, `b`, and `def`).

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy involves ensuring that the deserialization process (handled by `MAPPER.readValue()`) correctly maps the JSON data to the respective Java classes. Specifically, adjustments may be needed in the `_narrow` method of the deserialization process to properly handle subclass checks and instantiation. This includes:
1. Verifying and possibly improving the subclass check to ensure that `subclass` is indeed a subclass or the same class as `_class`.
2. Ensuring that the deserialization logic correctly identifies and assigns the JSON properties to the corresponding fields in the `Default1125` class.
3. Implementing or fixing the TODO in the `_narrow` method related to subclass relationship validation, which might be causing incorrect type instantiation or casting issues during JSON deserialization.
