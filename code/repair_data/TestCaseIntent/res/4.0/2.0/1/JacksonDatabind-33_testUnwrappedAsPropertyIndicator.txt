Intent: The purpose of the test case `testUnwrappedAsPropertyIndicator` is to verify that the serialization behavior correctly unwraps the properties of an inner object into the outer object. Specifically, it checks if the serialized JSON string contains the properties (`animal`) and their values (`Zebra`) directly under the outer object, without showing the nested structure (`inner`).

Repair strategy: To rectify the failing test case, the source code in the method `findNameForSerialization` needs to be adjusted to properly support and recognize annotations that indicate unwrapping behavior (such as `@JsonUnwrapped`). Currently, the method does not handle such scenarios where properties of nested objects need to be unwrapped into the containing object in the JSON output. The repair should involve:
1. Checking if the `Annotated` instance has an `@JsonUnwrapped` annotation.
2. If `@JsonUnwrapped` is present, modify the serialization logic to inline the properties of the annotated object into its parent.
3. Ensure that the unwrapping behavior is properly integrated into the existing condition checks and processing logic in `findNameForSerialization`, possibly by adding an additional condition to check for the `@JsonUnwrapped` annotation and handling the property name and serialization accordingly.
