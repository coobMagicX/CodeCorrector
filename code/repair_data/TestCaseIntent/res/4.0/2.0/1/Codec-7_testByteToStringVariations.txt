Intent: The test case `testByteToStringVariations` aims to verify that the `encodeBase64String` method correctly encodes various byte array inputs into Base64 strings, including typical string data, empty arrays, null inputs, and URL-safe encoding.

Repair strategy: The failing test case indicates a problem with how the `encodeBase64String` method handles standard Base64 encoding or interacts with its dependencies. Verify and correct the implementation of `encodeBase64` and `StringUtils.newStringUtf8` methods used within `encodeBase64String`. Ensure that they are correctly converting byte arrays to Base64 strings, handling different input scenarios (empty and null arrays), and correctly converting the encoded bytes back to a UTF-8 string. Additionally, ensure that the method uses the correct flags for standard Base64 encoding not URL-safe encoding unless explicitly specified by the method's purpose.
