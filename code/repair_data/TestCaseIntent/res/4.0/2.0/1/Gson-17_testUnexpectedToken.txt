Intent: The test case "testUnexpectedToken" is designed to ensure that the `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` correctly handles situations where the JSON input does not start with a STRING token as expected by the `read` method. It aims to verify that the method throws a proper exception when encountering a JSON object (`{}`) instead of a string representing a date.

Repair strategy: Modify the `read` method in the `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` class to correctly handle and throw a more appropriate exception when the JSON token is not what is expected. The current method only checks for a STRING token and throws a `JsonParseException` if this is not met. However, the test expects an `IllegalStateException`. The repair should involve adjusting the method to throw `IllegalStateException` or modifying the test to expect `JsonParseException` depending on the intended design of error handling in the application.
