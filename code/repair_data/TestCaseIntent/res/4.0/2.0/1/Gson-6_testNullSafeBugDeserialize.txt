Intent: The test case `testNullSafeBugDeserialize` is intended to validate the deserialization of a JSON string into a `Device` object using Gson, specifically ensuring that the `id` field of the `Device` object correctly captures the value from the JSON.

Repair strategy: Investigate the implementation of the `Device` class to ensure it is properly annotated to work with Gsonâ€™s deserialization process. Ensure that the `Device` class or the Gson setup does not improperly handle null values that might be introduced mistakenly through `nullSafe()` configuration in the `getTypeAdapter` method. Check if the `TypeAdapter` being used respects the provided annotations without misinterpreting null handling. Adjust the Gson configuration or `TypeAdapter` implementation to correctly interpret and deserialize the JSON input.
