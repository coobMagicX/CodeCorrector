Intent: The intent of the test case `testMissingRequiredOptions` is to ensure that the method `checkRequiredOptions` correctly identifies and throws an exception when required options specified in the `_options` object are not provided in the command line arguments (`args`). The test specifically checks that the exception message correctly lists the missing required options.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to ensure that the error message generated in the `checkRequiredOptions` method accurately reflects all missing required options in a consistently formatted string, including appropriate separators and order as expected by the test case. This may involve modifying how the missing options are collected and appended to the `StringBuffer` in the source code. Additionally, ensure that the system handles the identification and reporting of multiple missing required options correctly, possibly by revisiting the logic that checks and appends missing options to the buffer. This fix should also include ensuring the error message structure matches the expected output in the test, such as using commas to separate multiple options and ensuring no extraneous characters are included.
