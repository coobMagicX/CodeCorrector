Intent: The intent of the test case `testInnerEmptyNamespaceDOM` is to verify that the method `getNamespaceURI` correctly retrieves the namespace URI for an XML node structure where the inner element (`test` in this case) does not explicitly define a namespace, while its parent element (`b:foo`) does.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the method `getNamespaceURI` handles cases where child elements inherit the namespace from their parent elements correctly when no explicit namespace declaration is present on the child. This involves checking the inheritance of namespaces and adjusting the logic to traverse up the DOM tree to find the nearest namespace declaration if a direct namespace URI is not found on the given node. Ensure that the method correctly handles elements with prefixes that might imply a namespace inherited from their parents.
