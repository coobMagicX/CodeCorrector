Intent: The purpose of the test case `testCompress197` is to read through all entries in a `.tar` archive file without encountering any exceptions, primarily testing the integrity and the correct parsing of the tar file entries.

Repair strategy: The test case failure suggests an issue with handling and parsing the tar archive entries, possibly related to the `parseOctal` method used to read file metadata in the tar entries. The key areas for repair in the `parseOctal` method could include:
1. Ensuring the method accurately handles edge cases related to octal number parsing, such as leading zeros or spaces, and trailing null or space characters.
2. Verifying the logic that throws exceptions to ensure it only does so when truly encountering an invalid octal number sequence.
3. Adding or refining error handling around the boundaries of the input buffer (e.g., checking the start and end indices).
4. Reviewing the method's handling of tar file metadata that might not strictly conform to expectations (possibly due to differences in tar implementations or corruptions).
5. Conducting additional tests with various tar files to ensure robust parsing across different cases and potentially using a debugger to trace incorrect calculations or exceptions thrown by `parseOctal`.
