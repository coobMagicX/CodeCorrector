Intent: The test case `testReinsertionModeForThCells` is intended to verify that the `resetInsertionMode` function correctly identifies and transitions to the appropriate state when handling nested HTML elements within a `<th>` cell in a table. The test checks if the document body correctly maintains a specific number of child elements after parsing and potentially manipulating the HTML structure.

Repair strategy: Review and correct the handling logic within `resetInsertionMode` for `<th>` elements, as the function currently checks for "td" elements but not "th". This oversight likely causes incorrect state transitions or maintenance of HTML structure when nested tables are present within `<th>` elements. The repair should include:
1. Adding a condition to check for "th" alongside "td" in the conditional checks within the `resetInsertionMode` function.
2. Ensure that the state transitions for "th" elements are appropriately managed, especially when it involves nested structures like tables within tables.
