Intent:
The intent of the test case `testWonkyNumber173` is to ensure that the JsonPointer does not incorrectly interpret "1e0" (a string that resembles scientific notation) as a valid array index. This is important because "1e0" should not be parsed as an integer index (which would be 1 in standard integer form), but rather should be identified as an invalid format for an index in this context.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should focus on modifying the `_parseIndex` method to handle scenarios where the input string is in a format that could be confused with scientific notation or other non-integer representations. This can be achieved by enhancing the character validation loop to more accurately detect non-digit characters and formats that do not correspond to plain integer values. Additionally, consider implementing a regex-based validation to pre-check the format of the string before attempting to parse it as an integer. This would prevent strings like "1e0" from being incorrectly processed as integers.
