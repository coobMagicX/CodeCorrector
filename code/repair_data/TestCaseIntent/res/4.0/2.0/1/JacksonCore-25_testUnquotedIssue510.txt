Intent: The failed test cases seem intended to validate the handling of unquoted JSON fields and characters beyond typical ASCII range (e.g., character with value 256) in JSON parsing. These tests are crucial for ensuring the parser's robustness in dealing with large inputs and non-standard usage scenarios, such as unquoted keys and handling of special characters.

Repair strategy: Analyze and potentially revise the condition checks in the `_handleOddName2` method for character handling, especially for characters outside the typical ASCII range and at buffer boundaries. The method should include proper handling for characters that do not fit within the expected `codes` array and should ensure the buffer is correctly managed when near its capacity. Additionally, ensure that the method doesn't inadvertently break or miss characters when transitioning between segments of the text buffer. This may involve adjusting how characters are read and processed in the loop, ensuring that characters like `{`, `a`, and characters beyond the ASCII range are correctly identified as part of JSON field names or values.
