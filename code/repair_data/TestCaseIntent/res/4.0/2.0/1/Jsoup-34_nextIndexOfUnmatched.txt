Intent: The purpose of the test case `nextIndexOfUnmatched` is to verify that the `nextIndexOf` method correctly returns -1 when the input sequence which is supposed to be found does not exist in the provided `CharacterReader` input string.

Repair strategy: The test failure suggests that there might be an issue with how the search for the sequence is conducted when the sequence is not present. This could be due to an error in the loop conditions or the boundary checks within the `nextIndexOf` method. To repair the source code:
1. Review the condition in the inner while loop and the subsequent for loop to ensure they properly handle cases where the start character or the sequence is not found at all.
2. Verify and correct boundary conditions to ensure the method returns -1 when the sequence does not exist in the input.
3. Add additional checks to gracefully handle cases where the searched sequence is longer than the remaining substring from the current position in the input. Ensure that if the remaining characters are fewer than the sequence length, the method returns -1.
