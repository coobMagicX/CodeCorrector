Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue423` is to validate the functionality that extracts function names being called within a JavaScript-like structured code block, ensuring that all function calls within nested structures and IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) patterns are correctly identified and added to a set.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the source code to better handle nested function calls and IIFE patterns. This involves improving the tree traversal logic to ensure that all function calls, especially those within nested blocks or anonymous functions, are recognized and handled correctly. The source code should also ensure that it can handle different JavaScript patterns and structures such as anonymous functions, callbacks, and IIFE structures more robustly. This may include refining the logic that checks node types and extracts function names from different types of call expressions.
