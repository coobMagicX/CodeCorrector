Intent: The test case `testCOMPRESS178` aims to validate that when processing a tar file with a specific content (likely malformed or with unexpected data types), the method `getNextTarEntry` should throw an `IOException`. The expectation is that the root cause of this exception is an `IllegalArgumentException`, indicating improper argument handling or validation within the method.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that `getNextTarEntry` properly handles cases where the tar file contains incorrect or unexpected data that could lead to an `IllegalArgumentException`. This could involve adding more robust input validation and error handling within the method to detect and manage such scenarios appropriately. Specifically, inspect the input and header parsing logic to ensure that all potential faults are caught and handled correctly, throwing the appropriate exceptions as expected by the test.
