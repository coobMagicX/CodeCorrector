Intent:
The intent of the test case `testBinaryEncoder` is to verify that the `Base64` class, which implements the `BinaryEncoder` interface, correctly encodes a series of binary data into Base64 format. The test checks if the encoded output matches expected Base64 strings for various inputs, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the Base64 encoding process.

Repair strategy:
To address the test failures, ensure that the `Base64` class's encoding method properly converts binary data into the correct Base64 string format. This may involve debugging and verifying the implementation of the `encode` method in the `Base64` class. Check for issues such as incorrect handling of padding, incorrect index calculations, or mishandling of byte-to-character conversions. Adjust the encoding logic as necessary to align with the Base64 encoding standards.
