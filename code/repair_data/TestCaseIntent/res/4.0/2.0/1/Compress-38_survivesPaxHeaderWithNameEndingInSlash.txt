Intent: The test case `survivesPaxHeaderWithNameEndingInSlash` intends to verify that a `TarArchiveEntry` can correctly interpret and handle entries from a tar archive stream, particularly when processing a Pax header with an entry name that ends with a slash. The specific focus seems to be on ensuring that the entry name is correctly read as "package/package.json" and that no additional entries are erroneously read or interpreted after this entry.

Repair strategy: The failed test case suggests potential issues in the `TarArchiveEntry` handling or the stream processing in the method `is.getNextTarEntry()`. The source code provided does not directly relate to the failure since it involves methods for identifying directory status rather than parsing or handling tar entries. Therefore, the repair should focus on:
1. Ensuring that the `TarArchiveInputStream` and `TarArchiveEntry` correctly parse and handle tar entries, especially handling names correctly and managing Pax headers effectively.
2. Review and possibly update the logic in `getNextTarEntry()` to accurately determine the end of the stream or the presence of further entries following a Pax header.
3. Verify and enhance the handling of names ending with slashes within the tar entry processing logic to ensure they are treated consistently with tar archive standards and expectations.
