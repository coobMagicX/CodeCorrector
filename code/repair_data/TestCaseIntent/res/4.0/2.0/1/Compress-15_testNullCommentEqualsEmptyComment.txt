Intent: The test `testNullCommentEqualsEmptyComment` is intended to check the behavior of the `equals` method in the `ZipArchiveEntry` class when comparing two entries where one has a `null` comment and the other has an empty string as a comment. The expectation set by this test is that a `null` comment should be considered equivalent to an empty comment.

Repair strategy: Modify the `equals` method in the `ZipArchiveEntry` class to handle `null` values for comments in such a way that a `null` comment is treated as equivalent to an empty string comment. This can be achieved by updating the condition where comments are compared so that it checks for both `null` and empty strings and treats them as equivalent. Alternatively, before comparing the comments, convert any `null` values to empty strings.
