Intent: The test case handlesKnownEmptyBlocks is intended to verify the HTML parserâ€™s ability to correctly handle self-closing syntax for both known and unknown HTML tags. It checks whether the parser correctly converts self-closing tags into the appropriate open and close tag format, according to HTML specifications and common practices.

Repair strategy: The source code needs a modification in the handling of self-closing tags. Specifically, the parser should distinguish between known tags that should not be self-closing according to the HTML standard and unknown or custom tags that can be self-closing. The parser should enforce the generation of separate opening and closing tags for known elements that are not typically self-closing, even if they appear in self-closing form in the input. This can be implemented by enhancing the condition checks in the `insert` method to appropriately differentiate and process these scenarios, possibly by refining the logic in `if (startTag.isSelfClosing())`. Additionally, ensure the parser correctly handles the insertion of elements into the DOM, maintaining proper nesting and hierarchy.
