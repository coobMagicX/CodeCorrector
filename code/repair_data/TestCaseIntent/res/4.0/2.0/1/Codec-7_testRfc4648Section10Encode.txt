Intent: The intent of the test case `testRfc4648Section10Encode` is to verify that the `encodeBase64String` method correctly encodes input strings into their Base64 representation according to RFC 4648 Section 10 standards. This involves testing various lengths of input to ensure padding and non-padding scenarios are handled accurately.

Repair strategy: The fault-revealing line suggests a possible issue with how padding is managed or how binary data is being processed before encoding. To address this:
1. Check the `encodeBase64` method to ensure it handles padding correctly for single byte and other edge case inputs.
2. Verify if the `encodeBase64` correctly interprets the `boolean` parameter related to padding in its processing.
3. Review any related utility methods like `StringUtils.getBytesUtf8` to confirm they function as expected without altering the input data in unintended ways.
4. Consider edge cases in the input handling within `encodeBase64String` to make sure all inputs are encoded consistently according to the standard.
