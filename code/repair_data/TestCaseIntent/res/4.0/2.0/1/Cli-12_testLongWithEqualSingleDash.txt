Intent: The test case `testLongWithEqualSingleDash` is intended to verify that the parser correctly handles long options provided with a single dash and an equals sign (e.g., "-foo=bar"), mapping the argument "bar" to the option "foo".

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to correctly parse and handle long options that start with a single dash followed by an equals sign. The current implementation does not correctly handle cases where a long option is passed with a single dash and an equals sign, which causes the test to fail as it cannot retrieve the correct option value. The parser needs to be adjusted to differentiate and correctly handle both single-dash long options and double-dash long options, ensuring that the value after the equals sign is correctly associated with the specified long option key. This might involve checking if the option after removing leading hyphens still contains an equals sign, then splitting it into the key and value parts accordingly before adding them to tokens.
