Intent: The intent of the `testSimpleNumbers` method is to validate the JSON formatting visitor's functionality when handling different numeric types (such as `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger`). The test checks if the correct `NumberType` is assigned to each numeric type during serialization.

Repair strategy: The likely issue in the `acceptJsonFormatVisitor` method is that it incorrectly assigns `JsonParser.NumberType.BIG_INTEGER` to all float formats, including `BigDecimal`. The method needs a correction to properly define the number type based on the actual handled type. Modify the conditional structure in `acceptJsonFormatVisitor` to correctly differentiate between `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` types. Specifically, ensure that `BigDecimal` is assigned a `JsonParser.NumberType.BIG_DECIMAL` instead of `JsonParser.NumberType.BIG_INTEGER`. This change should help in passing the failing test case by producing the correct output string.
