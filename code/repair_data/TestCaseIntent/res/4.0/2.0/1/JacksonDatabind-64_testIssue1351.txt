Intent: The test case `testIssue1351` is intended to serialize objects of `Issue1351Bean` and `Issue1351NonBean` classes with the serialization inclusion rule set to `JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT`. This rule means that the output JSON should not include properties that are set to their default values. The expected outcome is to receive an empty JSON object `{}` because all properties in the object being serialized are set to their default values.

Repair strategy: The source code likely fails to correctly handle the `JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT` inclusion setting, particularly in the computation or handling of default values for properties. The repair should involve:

1. Verifying and possibly fixing the logic within the `NON_DEFAULT` case in the switch statement that handles different inclusion rules. Ensure that the logic correctly identifies and suppresses default values.
2. Ensuring that the method `getPropertyDefaultValue` (and related logic for defaults handling) accurately fetches or computes default values for properties, particularly for custom or non-standard types that might not have straightforward default values.
3. Reviewing the integration and effect of `_useRealPropertyDefaults` flag to ensure it works as intended, especially in scenarios where the default instance creation is complex or might fail.
4. Adding or improving unit tests to cover various scenarios under the `NON_DEFAULT` setting to catch any edge cases or missed behaviors.
