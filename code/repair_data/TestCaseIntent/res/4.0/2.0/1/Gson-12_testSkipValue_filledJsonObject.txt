Intent: The test case `testSkipValue_filledJsonObject()` is intended to verify that the `skipValue()` method correctly skips over all elements of a complex JSON structure (containing a mix of arrays, nested objects, and various types of properties) and correctly manages the internal parsing stack, such that it reaches the end of the document after a single call to `skipValue()`.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `skipValue()` might not be properly handling the traversal and skipping of nested JSON structures, especially when it comes to nested arrays and objects. The repair should focus on ensuring that `skipValue()` comprehensively and recursively skips all elements within compound structures like arrays and objects. This can involve checking and modifying how `popStack()`, `nextName()`, and index adjustments are handled to ensure that the parser's state accurately reflects the document structure after skipping, and that it correctly identifies the end of the document. Additionally, verifying and adjusting the stack manipulation logic (including conditions for popping elements off the stack and setting path names/indices) will be crucial to ensure that the parser's internal state remains consistent across various JSON structures.
