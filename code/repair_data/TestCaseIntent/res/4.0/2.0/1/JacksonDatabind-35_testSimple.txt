Intent: The intent of the test case `testSimple` is to serialize a `Company` object containing a list of computers into JSON format using Jackson's `ObjectMapper`, and then deserialize the JSON string back into a `Company` object. The test then checks if the deserialized `Company` object is not null, its list of computers is also not null, and that the list contains exactly 3 computers as originally added. The purpose is to ensure both serialization and deserialization processes work correctly and preserve the integrity and structure of the data.

Repair strategy: Given the failure at the line `Company result = mapper.readValue(json, Company.class);` and based on the provided source code, the error might be occurring during the deserialization process. The source code seems to handle type information for deserialization based on JSON structure and type identifiers. The key repair direction would be:
1. Ensure that the JSON produced by serialization correctly encodes type information if necessary (this depends on how `Company` and computer classes like `DesktopComputer` and `LaptopComputer` are annotated or configured in Jackson).
2. Verify and possibly adjust the deserialization process to correctly interpret and utilize the type information in JSON, focusing primarily on handling polymorphic types if `Company`'s `computers` list contains different types of `Computer` objects.
3. Check the configuration of `ObjectMapper` to ensure it is set up to handle polymorphic deserialization and any custom configurations like visibility of type ids or property-based handling are correctly set.
4. Review and test the `_deserializeWithNativeTypeId` method and related methods to ensure they handle the types and structure outlined in the JSON string correctly. If these methods are failing to reconstruct the `Company` object as expected, adjustments or additional error handling might be required there.
