Intent: The test case `testIssue726` aims to verify type checking functionality within a JavaScript codebase. It specifically checks that the type of actual parameters passed to a method matches the expected type as defined in the method's annotations.

Repair strategy: The source code likely contains a type-checking mechanism that needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the scopes and context in which types are analyzed. The portion of the code that should be scrutinized and potentially revised includes how the function `visit` processes and records variable assignments and type expectations. A more robust or accurate handling of scope traversal and variable type recording in nested functions could be necessary to ensure that variable types are checked correctly against their expected types as specified in the method's annotations. Ensure that the system is accurately identifying and validating types according to the context in which they are used, particularly in closures or functions returned by other functions.
