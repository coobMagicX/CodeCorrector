Intent:
The intent of the test case `testExpand()` is to ensure that the method `expandCurrentSegment()` successfully increases the size of a buffer. The buffer should expand until it reaches or exceeds a specified size of 500,000 characters. The test verifies that with each invocation of `expandCurrentSegment()`, the buffer's length grows compared to its previous size.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should involve adjusting the logic for buffer size expansion in the `expandCurrentSegment()` method. Specifically, it appears that the buffer does not always grow as expected when it reaches the size threshold defined by the constant `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`. This issue could be due to incorrect or insufficient increase increments or an unhandled edge case when the buffer size exactly matches `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`. The code should be modified to ensure that the buffer size consistently increases by a significant amount (e.g., at least 25% as intended for maximum sizes) and handles the transition through `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` smoothly. The logic for calculating `newLen` might need refinement to handle these scenarios adequately. Additionally, ensuring that `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` is defined appropriately and used correctly throughout the code is crucial.
