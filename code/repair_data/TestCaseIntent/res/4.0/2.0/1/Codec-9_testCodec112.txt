Intent: The purpose of the test case `testCodec112` is to verify that the `encodeBase64` function correctly handles the encoding of a single-byte array without chunking, and that the function obeys the specified maximum result size. This test checks whether the size calculation correctly adjusts based on whether the output is chunked or not.

Repair strategy: Modify the implementation of `encodeBase64` to accurately calculate the expected length of the encoded data when the `isChunked` parameter is false. Ensure that the `getEncodeLength` method or its usage accounts for both chunked and non-chunked scenarios, adjusting the calculation based on the `isChunked` parameter. This may involve revising the logic in `getEncodeLength` or how it's called in `encodeBase64` to ensure it correctly reflects the non-chunked output size when `isChunked` is false.
