Intent:
The intent of the test case `testEqualsAfterSerializationOfDerivedClass` is to ensure that an instance of a derived class (`DerivedMultiKey`) remains equal in terms of its hash code before and after serialization and deserialization. This is crucial for ensuring that the serialization process preserves the equality and hash consistency of objects, which is particularly important in contexts where serialized objects are used in collections like hash sets or hash maps.

Repair strategy:
To address the failure in the test case, the focus should be on ensuring that the `readResolve` method in the `DerivedMultiKey` class (or its superclass, if `DerivedMultiKey` does not override `readResolve`) correctly recalculates or reinstates any transient or calculated fields that contribute to the hash code calculation. If the `calculateHashCode` method is intended to reinitialize or recalibrate these fields post-deserialization, verify that it correctly recomputes values based on the deserialized data. If the hash code is incorrect, ensure that all fields relevant to the hash code calculation are being correctly considered and that no data is lost or incorrectly initialized during the serialization-deserialization cycle. Also, consider overriding the `readResolve` method in the `DerivedMultiKey` class if needed to handle any additional properties specific to the derived class.
