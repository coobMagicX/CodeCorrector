Intent: The test case `testCompressedHeaderWithNonDefaultDictionarySize` aims to verify that a 7zip file with a non-default dictionary size can be opened correctly and all entries can be read accurately. The focus here is on ensuring the decompression library correctly handles compressed files with non-standard settings, specifically dictionary sizes.

Repair strategy: Investigate the handling of the dictionary size in the `decode` method, ensuring that the method correctly interprets and sets up the dictionary size for the LZMAInputStream. Review the calculation and passing of the dictionary size from the `coder.properties`, ensuring that all significant bytes are correctly shifted and combined into the `dictSize`. It's crucial to confirm that no integer overflow or incorrect bit manipulation occurs during this process. Additionally, verify and adjust the error handling for dictionary sizes that exceed the allowed maximum, ensuring that the input stream can still initialize correctly under varying conditions. Consider adding more robust type checks or conversions to manage larger or unexpected dictionary sizes.
