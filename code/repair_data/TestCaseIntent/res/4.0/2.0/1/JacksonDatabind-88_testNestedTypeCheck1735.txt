Intent: The purpose of the test case `testNestedTypeCheck1735` is to ensure that the system correctly handles and validates type information when deserializing nested generic types, specifically checking that the nested types are compatible and are subtypes of the expected base types. The test expects a failure when the type does not meet these conditions.

Repair strategy: Modify the `_typeFromId` method to include additional checks and validations for subtype compatibility between the constructed type and the base type. This could involve enhancing the handling within the `constructSpecializedType` method of the `TypeFactory` class or directly within the `_typeFromId` method to ensure that the specialization respects the base type compatibility requirements before returning the specialized type. This check should ensure that the specialized type is indeed a subtype of `_baseType`, handling cases where generic types are deeply nested or involve complex type hierarchies.
