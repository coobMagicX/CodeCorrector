Intent: The test case `testSupAndInfOfReturnTypesWithNumOfParams` is designed to check the supertype and subtype relationships between two function types: one that accepts two number parameters and returns a boolean, and another that accepts one number parameter and returns a boolean. The test aims to assert whether the type system correctly handles function arity (number of parameters) and return types in determining these relationships.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a proper handling of function arity when determining the subtype and supertype relationships. Specifically, the code needs to properly manage cases where a function with fewer parameters might be treated as a subtype of a function with more parameters, depending on the "required-ness" of those parameters. This might involve adjusting the loop that iterates over parameters to ensure that the absence of a parameter in `thatParam` when `thisParam` still has parameters (or vice versa) is handled correctly to reflect the intended design of function subtyping in the type system. Additionally, the type system's handling of varargs and required parameters in relation to subtyping rules needs to be clarified or corrected to ensure that the subtype and supertype assertions are accurately evaluated.
