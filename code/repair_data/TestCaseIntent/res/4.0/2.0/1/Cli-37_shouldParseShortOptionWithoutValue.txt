Intent: The test case intends to verify that the command line parser correctly identifies and parses two short options without values. Specifically, it tests that each option is recognized as a separate entity and that one option's presence does not mistakenly appear as the value of another option.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to ensure that the `isShortOption` method correctly identifies each short option and does not mistakenly associate subsequent options as values of the preceding option. This might involve refining the logic that differentiates between options and potential values or enhancing the way options are extracted and stored during parsing.
