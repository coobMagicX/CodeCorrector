Intent: The test case `testSevenEmptyFiles` appears to be testing the functionality of the `writeBits` method when it is tasked with writing zero bits across seven segments. The purpose is likely to ensure that the method correctly handles scenarios with minimal or no data to write, potentially simulating an edge case where files or data segments are empty.

Repair strategy: From the given source code and the nature of the failure, it seems that the method `writeBits` may not be correctly handling cases where `length` is zero, which should result in no action (no data written). However, the method's control flow does not explicitly handle the scenario where `length` equals zero from the onset. The repair should thus involve adding a condition to immediately exit or skip processing if the `length` parameter is zero. This would prevent any operations, including unnecessary checks or writes, when there is effectively nothing to write, ensuring the function gracefully handles empty or zero-length data inputs.
