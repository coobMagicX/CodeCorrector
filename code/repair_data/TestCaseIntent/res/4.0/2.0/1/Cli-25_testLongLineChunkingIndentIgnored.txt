Intent:
The purpose of the test case `testLongLineChunkingIndentIgnored` is to verify that long lines are correctly wrapped and indented according to specified parameters when using a command-line help formatter. The test aims to ensure that descriptions and other elements are displayed neatly across multiple lines without exceeding the given width, and that they maintain the required indentation on subsequent lines.

Repair strategy:
The code likely fails because the initial indentation set by `nextLineTabStop` isn't effectively applied to subsequent lines after the first wrap, possibly due to incorrect calculations or handling in the loop that processes the remaining text. The key directions for repair include:

1. Verifying and adjusting the logic that calculates the position `pos` to wrap the text. Ensure that it properly accounts for the width and the indentations.
2. Ensure that the `nextLineTabStop` value is used correctly to maintain consistent indentation across wrapped lines, particularly after the first line.
3. Investigate and possibly correct the logic that appends the wrapped lines to the `StringBuffer sb`, making sure that the indentation and trimming are correctly applied to each line according to the test expectations.
4. Review and possibly revise the conditions that reset or adjust the `nextLineTabStop` in the loop to prevent inappropriate adjustments that could lead to improper formatting or infinite loops.
