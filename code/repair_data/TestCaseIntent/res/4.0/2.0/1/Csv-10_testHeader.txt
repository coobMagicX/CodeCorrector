Intent: The purpose of the test case is to verify that the CSVPrinter class correctly formats output with specified column headers followed by multiple records. The test ensures that the CSVPrinter can handle null quote characters and still output correct CSV formatted text including headers and records, each followed by a new line.

Repair strategy: Review the CSVPrinter classâ€™s handling of the CSVFormat configuration and printing logic. Ensure that the header preparation and output occur correctly when printing the first record if headers are specified. The condition or method responsible for printing headers should be checked to ensure that it triggers on the first print call when headers are included in the CSVFormat. Additionally, verify that handling of null quote characters does not interfere with the correct formatting of the output. If the headers are not being printed as expected, the initialization or conditional logic for handling headers in the CSVPrinter might need adjustment. Adjust the logic to ensure headers are printed exactly once before the first record and that the subsequent records are formatted in line with the CSV configuration provided.
