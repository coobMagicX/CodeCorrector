Intent: The intent of the `normalise` function is to move all non-blank text nodes from a given element to the body of the document. The test case is intended to verify that text outside the main HTML body but within the root of the document is correctly moved to the start of the body element when normalized.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should involve adjusting the `normalise` function to ensure that it correctly identifies and moves text nodes that are initially outside of the body element but still within the document's root. This should include a condition to check and handle cases where text nodes are direct children of the document root, moving them appropriately to the body element. Additionally, ensure that the order of text and elements in the `body()` is preserved correctly after moving nodes.
