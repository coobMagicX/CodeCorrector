Intent: The purpose of these test cases is to validate the correct parsing of ISO 8601 date strings with partial milliseconds into `java.util.Date` objects, ensuring the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond components are accurately extracted and reflect the specified timezone adjustments.

Repair strategy: Since the test failures indicate issues with parsing dates containing partial milliseconds and potentially the timezone adjustments, the repair should focus on refining the parsing logic within the `parseAsISO8601` method. Specifically:

1. Ensure the method correctly interprets and handles date strings with partial milliseconds (e.g., `.6` or `.61`) without assuming a fixed format or appending zeros indiscriminately.
2. Adjust the timezone conversion logic to accurately reflect the parsed timezone in the resultant `Date` object.
3. Verify and possibly correct the logic that modifies the input string based on the presence of time zone indicators and partial milliseconds to prevent string manipulation errors that lead to incorrect parsing outcomes.
4. Implement additional unit tests to cover edge cases for timezone and milliseconds to ensure robustness in the parsing functionality.
