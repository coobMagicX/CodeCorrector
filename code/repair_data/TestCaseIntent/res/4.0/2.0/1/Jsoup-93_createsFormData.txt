Intent: The purpose of the test case `createsFormData` is to verify that the `formData` method correctly parses an HTML form and extracts the correct key-value pairs for submittable form elements, adhering to conditions like element type, selected options, and attributes such as "checked" or "disabled". The test checks for the correct handling of various form elements like input (text, checkbox, radio), select, and textarea, ensuring that only the form elements meant to be submitted are included in the resultant list.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle multiple selected options under a single select element correctly. Currently, the code might be incorrectly adding multiple entries for each selected option when it should potentially handle them based on specific form behavior (e.g., only considering the first selected option or handling multiple selections correctly depending on the form attribute). Additionally, the handling of checkboxes and radio buttons needs verification to ensure that only checked items are being added. There might be an issue with how the disabled and button type inputs are filtered out, or an error in counting or filtering out duplicate name entries for radio buttons, which should be addressed to align with the test expectations. The repair should focus on refining the selection and filtering logic to match the form submission rules accurately.
