Intent: The test case `testIssue1056` is designed to check the type handling and property access of variables declared with specific types but initialized with `null`. It aims to ensure that the type system in the source code correctly tracks and enforces type constraints even when a variable is initially set to `null` but later used in a context that assumes a different type (in this case, an `Array`).

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to handle cases where variables declared with a specific type are initialized with `null` and then used in a way that is inconsistent with the `null` type. The repair should include:
- Enhancing the type-checking mechanism to recognize and correctly handle `null` initializations, especially when subsequent operations assume the variable to be of a declared non-null type.
- Adjusting the logic that determines the effective type of a variable (`isVarTypeBetter` logic) to account for the declared type even when the initial assignment is `null`.
- Ensuring that operations like `.push()` on arrays are validated against the declared type rather than the initial value (`null` in this case). This might involve refining the inference and redeclaration logic to handle `null` values more effectively, maintaining type safety and consistency.
