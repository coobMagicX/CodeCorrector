Intent: The purpose of the failing test case `testArrayWithDefaultTyping` is to verify if the `ObjectMapper` configured with default typing can correctly parse JSON into `JsonNode` arrays and objects, ensuring that arrays and objects are properly recognized and their contents accurately extracted.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring the `ObjectMapper` with default typing correctly handles the parsing of JSON data into the appropriate `JsonNode` types without misclassification or errors in the node content retrieval. This could involve reviewing the `useForType` method in the context of how types are determined for deserialization, particularly ensuring that the method's handling of array types and their content types aligns with the expected behavior when default typing is enabled. Additionally, check for any issues in the integration of `ObjectMapper` and `JsonNode` that could lead to incorrect parsing or node type recognition.
