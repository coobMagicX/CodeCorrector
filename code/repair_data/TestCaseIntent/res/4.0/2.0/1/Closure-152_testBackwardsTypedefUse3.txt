Intent: The test case `testBackwardsTypedefUse3` is designed to ensure that the method `resolveInternal` correctly handles type resolution for typedefs that appear after their usage in comments, specifically checking that the type of `this` in a function context resolves correctly to an object type, even when the typedef includes a union of types which might not individually be object types.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle cases where `typeOfThis` might resolve to a `UnionType` that includes non-object types, such as in this test case where `MyTypedef` is a union of `Date` and `Array`. The repair should ensure that when `typeOfThis` is resolved and is found to be a `UnionType`, the code should check if all members of the union are `ObjectType`s, and if not, it should either resolve to a common object type if possible or handle the error appropriately. This might involve adding a check for `UnionType` and implementing logic to handle it correctly in the context of function `this` types.
