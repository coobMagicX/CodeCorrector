Intent: The purpose of the test `testHashAndEquals` is to verify the implementation of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `Element` class. The test checks whether elements with the same HTML content are considered equal and have the same hash code, and elements with different content are not equal and have different hash codes.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of the `equals` method in the `Element` class contains a faulty return statement `return this == o;` which checks for reference equality rather than logical equality. The repair should involve modifying the `equals` method to correctly compare the properties (such as the HTML content) of the `Element` objects to determine equality. This might include comparing text content, attributes, tag names, etc., depending on what defines equality for an `Element`. Additionally, ensure that `hashCode` is implemented to be consistent with `equals`, meaning equal elements should have the same hash code. This can be done by computing the hash code based on the same properties used in the `equals` method.
