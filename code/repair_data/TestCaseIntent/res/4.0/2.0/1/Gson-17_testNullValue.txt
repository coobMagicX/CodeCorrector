Intent: The purpose of the failing test case (`testNullValue`) is to verify that the method `fromJson` can correctly handle JSON `null` values by returning `null` when a `null` JSON string is passed as an input.

Repair strategy: Modify the `read` method to properly handle JSON `null` values by checking if the `JsonToken` is `NULL`. If it is, return `null` before attempting to deserialize the date string. This will prevent the method from throwing a `JsonParseException` and instead allow it to return `null` as expected when a `null` input is provided.
