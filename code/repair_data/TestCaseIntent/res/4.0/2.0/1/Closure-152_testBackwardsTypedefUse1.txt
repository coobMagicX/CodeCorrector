Intent: The test case `testBackwardsTypedefUse1` is designed to check if the type resolution mechanism handles the situation where a function is annotated to use a type that is defined later in the code as a typedef. The test specifically expects the mechanism to correctly handle and flag a scenario where a type reference (e.g., `MyTypedef`) is used before its declaration, especially when the typedef represents a primitive type (e.g., `string`), but the function's `@this` annotation expects an object type.

Repair strategy: Adapt the source code to include a validation step that checks if the resolved type for `@this` in a function matches the expected category (i.e., object type, not a primitive or other non-object types). This involves modifying the `safeResolve` method or the logic around where `typeOfThis` is assigned to ensure that the type of `this` is correctly identified as an object or that an error is correctly thrown when it's not. The code should include a specific check to ensure that typedefs that resolve to non-object types are flagged as errors when used in contexts where an object type is required. Implement a pre-check for typedefs to verify their types before applying them to function contexts.
