Intent: The intent of the test case `testEmptyNodeSetOperations` is to verify that XPath expressions which reference non-existent nodes or empty node sets behave correctly when compared to a numeric value using different operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`). The expected behavior in these tests is that all comparisons with non-existent nodes or empty node sets should return `Boolean.FALSE`, indicating that the comparison is false.

Repair strategy: Based on the test case failure (`/idonotexist >= 0` returning an unexpected result), the source code likely does not handle comparisons involving non-existent nodes or empty node sets correctly. The repair direction should involve modifying the `computeValue` method or related computation logic to ensure that any operations involving non-existent nodes or empty node sets correctly evaluate to false. This may involve enhancing null or empty checks within the `compute` method or ensuring that default values are correctly set and utilized during comparisons. Additionally, consider handling specific edge cases for comparisons like `>=` and `<=` when nodes are absent.
