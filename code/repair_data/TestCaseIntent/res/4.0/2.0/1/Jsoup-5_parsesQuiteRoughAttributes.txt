Intent: The test case "parsesQuiteRoughAttributes" is intended to verify that the HTML parser can correctly handle and parse HTML content that includes malformed or unusual attribute syntax. The parser should be able to gracefully handle cases where equal signs are misplaced, attributes are partially specified without values, and irregular characters are used in place of standard attribute formatting.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to enhance its robustness in handling malformed attributes. Specifically, the parsing logic needs to be refined to:
1. Better detect and skip over malformed attributes while still correctly parsing the surrounding HTML structure.
2. Ensure that unexpected characters or sequences within the attributes do not disrupt the overall parsing of the HTML elements.
3. Include more comprehensive checks for attribute boundaries and terminations, especially when attributes are not closed as expected or when unusual characters appear within an element tag.

This repair may involve implementing more rigorous state checks and error handling within the `parseAttribute` method to manage unexpected input more effectively without misinterpreting it or allowing it to affect the parsing of valid parts of the HTML.
