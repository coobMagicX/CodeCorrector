Intent: The intent of the test case `testJDKTypes1872` is to ensure that the serialization and deserialization process correctly handles the `Authentication1872` class, specifically when using default typing for non-final classes with Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should focus on investigating whether the class `Authentication1872` or any of its superclasses or implemented interfaces are inadvertently blocked by the conditions in `validateSubType`. Check if the class name or its superclass names match with the conditions that are meant to detect and block certain class names or patterns. Adjust the conditional logic in `validateSubType` to correctly allow `Authentication1872` class and similar legitimate classes, ensuring they are not falsely identified as security risks.
