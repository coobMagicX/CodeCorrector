Intent: The test `testIssue2088UnwrappedFieldsAfterLastCreatorProp` is designed to verify that the `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` method correctly handles deserialization of JSON input into an object (`Issue2088Bean`) where some properties (`a` and `b`) are expected to be unwrapped into a nested object (`w`), and also checks that properties (`x` and `y`) are set correctly on the main object.

Repair strategy: The potential issue in the source code could be related to the handling and assignment of unwrapped properties after the last creator property has been set. The method may not be correctly buffering or assigning these unwrapped properties to the nested object. To address this:
1. Review and adjust the logic in `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` that handles the transition from setting creator properties to handling regular or unwrapped properties.
2. Ensure that after the last creator property is processed, any subsequent properties are correctly identified as belonging to the nested unwrapped object and are assigned appropriately.
3. Verify that the logic correctly differentiates between properties meant for the main object and properties meant for the unwrapped object, especially in scenarios where properties for the unwrapped object appear after the last creator property in the JSON input.
