Intent: The intent of the test case `testMissingOptionsException` is to ensure that when options marked as required are not provided in the input, the system correctly throws a `MissingOptionException` with a message specifying which required options are missing. This is to validate the functionality of handling missing required options in command-line argument parsing.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly format the exception message to match the expected output in the test case. This includes adding a prefix such as "Missing required options: " to the `StringBuffer` before appending the missing options, and ensuring that the required options are appended in a manner that matches the expected format (e.g., no extra separators, correct order). Consider enhancing the logic in `checkRequiredOptions` to format the output string as per the test expectations.
