Intent: The test case `testMissingOptionsException` is designed to verify that the `MissingOptionException` is correctly thrown and formatted when required options are not provided to the parser. The intent is to ensure that the exception message accurately lists all missing required options, formatted as a string with each option separated by a comma and a space.

Repair strategy: Modify the `checkRequiredOptions` method in the source code to correctly format the list of missing options, ensuring each option is separated by a comma and a space. This involves adjusting the loop that appends each option to the `StringBuffer buff` to include a comma and a space between each option, and handling the formatting to avoid a trailing comma after the last option.
