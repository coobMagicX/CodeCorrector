Intent: The `testParseOctalInvalid` method is designed to verify that the `parseOctal` function properly handles various invalid input scenarios including empty or too short buffers, buffers containing invalid octal characters (non-numeric and non-octal numeric characters), and buffers with improper characters such as embedded spaces or null characters within the octal sequence.

Repair strategy: Modify the `parseOctal` function to not only check the boundaries and initial character conditions but also to more robustly handle illegal characters within the octal number sequence. Specifically, ensure that after skipping leading spaces and trimming trailing nulls and spaces, the function should verify that there are no embedded spaces, nulls, or other illegal characters (as per octal parsing rules) in the middle of the octal number sequence. This can be achieved by refining the condition checks within the main parsing loop and enhancing error handling and message reporting when encountering these scenarios. Additionally, ensure the length checks at the beginning accommodate cases where the effective length after trimming might fall below the minimum required length. Adjust the trimming logic to correctly manage the buffer's end boundary to ensure it doesn't prematurely exclude valid characters or fail to exclude invalid trailing characters.
