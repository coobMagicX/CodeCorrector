Intent:
The test case `testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldNameChars` is intended to ensure that the method `writeValue()` handles the situation where a string that does not consist of valid field name characters is written. The test likely checks whether the method throws an exception or returns an error status when attempting to write invalid field names in an object context.

Repair strategy:
The `writeValue()` method currently does not have any checks or logic to handle invalid field names for objects. The repair should involve adding logic to validate field names if the `_type` is `TYPE_OBJECT`. This could include checking whether the string to be written as a field name contains only valid characters (according to whatever rules are defined for field names). If the field name is invalid, the method should either throw an exception or return a specific error status code indicating the issue. This validation should occur before updating `_gotName` or `_index`.
