Intent: The test case `testUnmodifiable` is intended to verify that the `ObjectMapper` can correctly deserialize JSON representing an unmodifiable set, using a custom mixin to handle the unmodifiable set type and enabling default typing to handle polymorphism.

Repair strategy: The failure indicates potential issues with handling default typing and mixins in the deserialization process, particularly with special or non-standard collection types like unmodifiable sets. The repair should focus on ensuring that the `ObjectMapper` is configured to properly recognize and utilize the provided mixins for unmodifiable sets, and that it handles the polymorphic deserialization correctly under default typing settings. This might involve adjusting how mixins are applied or improving the handling of type information during deserialization.
