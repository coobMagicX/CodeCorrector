Intent: The test `testPOJONodeCustomSer` is intended to serialize a Java object (`Data` with a `String` field) into JSON format using a custom serialization process that modifies the output. Specifically, it aims to serialize an object and a map containing the object, both wrapped in different JSON node types (`ObjectNode` and `Map`) and checks if they are serialized to the expected format which includes custom text formatting.

Repair strategy: The error likely resides in how custom serialization handles the `ObjectNode` compared to a direct `Map` serialization. The code may need to ensure that custom attributes or serialization processes applied in one context (like a direct map) are equivalently applied when using `ObjectNode`. This could involve modifying the serialization logic to consistently handle different types of containers (`Map` vs. `ObjectNode`) or ensuring that the context (`SerializerProvider`) correctly propagates and applies custom attributes or serialization rules across different types of JSON nodes.
