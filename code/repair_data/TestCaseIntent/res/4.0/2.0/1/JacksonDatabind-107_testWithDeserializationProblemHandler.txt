Intent: The test is intended to verify that the deserialization process can handle unknown type IDs correctly by utilizing a custom `DeserializationProblemHandler`. Specifically, the test checks whether the system can still deserialize JSON into a `GenericContent` object and correctly populate its `innerObjects` field, even when encountering an unknown type ID during the deserialization process.

Repair strategy: The implementation of `_findDeserializer` should be modified to properly utilize the custom `DeserializationProblemHandler` when `typeFromId` returns `null` and `_handleUnknownTypeId` does not resolve to a valid type. Instead of returning `null` immediately after `_handleUnknownTypeId` returns `null`, the method should allow for a fallback mechanism or throw a more informative exception to handle this case more gracefully. This ensures that when an unknown type ID is encountered, the system still performs robustly by either using a default deserializer or handling the error in a way that does not break the deserialization process. Additionally, ensure `_deserializers.put(typeId, deser)` is called only when a valid `deser` is available, preventing potential null entries that could lead to failures in subsequent deserialization attempts.
