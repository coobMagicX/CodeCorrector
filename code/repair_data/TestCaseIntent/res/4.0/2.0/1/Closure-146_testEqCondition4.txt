Intent: The intent of the test case `testEqCondition4` is to validate the behavior of the `getTypesUnderInequality` method when both operands involved in the equality operation (`Token.EQ`) are of type `VOID_TYPE`. The expected behavior seems to be that types should transition from `VOID_TYPE` to `NO_TYPE` under the equality condition.

Repair strategy: The source code should be examined to ensure that it correctly handles cases where types are `VOID_TYPE`. Specifically, the method `getTypesUnderInequality` does not seem to account for special handling when both types are `VOID_TYPE` or transitioning types under specific conditions like equality to `NO_TYPE`. The `testForEquality` switch case should include logic that explicitly addresses the behavior of `VOID_TYPE` and potentially other special types, adapting the return values accordingly. This might involve adjusting the `switch` statement or adding additional condition checks before it to handle special type cases like `VOID_TYPE`.
