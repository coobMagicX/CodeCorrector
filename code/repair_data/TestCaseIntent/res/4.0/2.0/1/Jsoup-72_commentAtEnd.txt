Intent: The intent of the test case `commentAtEnd` is to verify that when an incomplete HTML comment tag (`<!`) is parsed, it is recognized and parsed as a `Comment` node in the document structure.

Repair strategy: To address the failing test case, the repair direction should focus on modifying the HTML parsing logic to ensure that incomplete comment tags are handled correctly. This could involve adjusting the parser's behavior to treat certain incomplete syntaxes as comments, particularly when they start with `<!` but do not close properly. This might include implementing or refining a fallback mechanism in the parser that defaults to creating a comment node when it encounters ambiguous or incomplete comment tags. This would ensure that the parsed structure aligns with the expected output of treating such input as comments rather than ignoring them or parsing them incorrectly.
