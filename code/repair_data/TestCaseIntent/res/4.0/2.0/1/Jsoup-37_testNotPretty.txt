Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the HTML output of a `div` element is correctly returned without any additional formatting or trimming of whitespace and line breaks when pretty print is set to false. This is essential for scenarios where exact reproduction of input HTML is required, such as in web scraping or HTML processing applications.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the `html()` method in the source code to ensure that it respects the `prettyPrint` settings of the document. This might involve checking if the method that generates the HTML output of individual elements (like `div`) is considering the `outputSettings().prettyPrint()` configuration. If the settings are to not pretty print, the method should not alter whitespace or line breaks from the original HTML content. Adjust the implementation to preserve original formatting when pretty print is disabled.
