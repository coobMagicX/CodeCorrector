Intent: The test case `testWithUnwrappedAndCreatorSingleParameterInMiddle` intends to validate the deserialization of a JSON object into a `Person` class object using a custom creator. The JSON object includes fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, `person_id`, `years_old`, and `living` which are expected to map correctly to the corresponding properties of the `Person` instance, including a nested object for the name.

Repair strategy: The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `years_old` field during the deserialization process. Since the test case fails specifically at `assertEquals(30, person.getAge());`, the likely cause is that the `years_old` JSON property is not being correctly mapped to the `age` property of the `Person` class. The repair should focus on ensuring that:
1. The `years_old` field is recognized and correctly mapped to the `age` property in the JSON deserialization process. This might involve updating the mapping configuration or annotations in the `Person` class.
2. Ensure that any custom deserialization logic in `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` correctly handles and assigns the `years_old` field to the `age` property of the `Person` object. This might require adjusting the logic that populates the `PropertyValueBuffer` or the handling of this specific field in the conditionals that manage property assignments.
