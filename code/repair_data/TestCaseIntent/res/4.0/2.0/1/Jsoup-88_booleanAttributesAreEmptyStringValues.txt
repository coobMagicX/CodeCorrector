Intent: The test case `booleanAttributesAreEmptyStringValues` aims to validate that boolean HTML attributes, like `hidden` in a `<div>` tag, are correctly parsed and handled as attributes with empty string values. The test verifies both the retrieval of the attribute from a collection and directly from an attribute object.

Repair strategy: Modify the `getValue()` method or the underlying attribute parsing mechanism to handle boolean attributes correctly. Ensure that boolean attributes (those without explicit values) are represented with empty string values (`""`) rather than `null` or any other default value. This may involve adjusting the document parsing logic to differentiate between absent attribute values and boolean attributes, setting boolean attributes to `""` during the parsing process.
