Intent: The intent of the test case `testReadWinZipArchive` is to verify that the application can successfully read various files from a zip archive that was created with WinZip using UTF-8 encoding. The test specifically checks the ability to read files with names that potentially include special or non-ASCII characters.

Repair strategy: Given that the assertCanRead fails specifically for `EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT`, a potential issue may lie in the handling of file names with special characters or in UTF-8 encoded file names. The repair should focus on ensuring that the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` method correctly processes and reconstructs file names with non-ASCII characters. This includes:
1. Verifying and possibly correcting the reading and setting of file names from the zip entry's extra fields, particularly when the UTF-8 flag is not set.
2. Ensuring that the encoding used to interpret byte arrays into strings correctly handles UTF-8 encoded names.
3. Checking and adjusting how file name changes are managed in the `nameMap` to ensure that entries are accurately updated or retrieved based on the actual file names after extraction.
