Intent: The intent of the test case `testRoundTripOctalOrBinary8()` is to verify that the method `formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes` can correctly handle and convert a numeric value into an octal or binary representation, specifically when the length of the buffer is 8. This length is typical for values like file sizes in certain file systems or archives.

Repair strategy: The source code should accurately determine when to use octal or binary formatting based on the value's size and the specified buffer length. The primary issues seem to be related to the lack of a return statement in the conditional block handling binary formats for values when `length < 9`. This might cause the last format method (`formatBigIntegerBinary`) to be erroneously called even after `formatLongBinary` has executed correctly for lengths less than 9. To repair the code:
1. Ensure a return statement is present after calling `formatLongBinary` within the `if (length < 9)` block if that call completes the method's intended action.
2. Review the conditions under which `formatBigIntegerBinary` is called to ensure it is only used when appropriate, preventing overlap or unnecessary execution.
