Intent: The purpose of the test case `quoteReplacements` is to verify that the `unescape` function correctly converts HTML entity references for characters that are also used as metacharacters in Java regular expressions (like backslash `\` and dollar sign `$`) into their corresponding literal characters.

Repair strategy: Modify the `unescape` function to properly handle special characters that have significance in regular expressions. Specifically, ensure that characters like backslash and dollar sign, when unescaped, are not misinterpreted by the `appendReplacement` method of the `Matcher` class. This might involve using `Matcher.quoteReplacement` to handle special characters properly during the replacement process. Consider implementing a custom replacement logic if necessary to avoid issues with special regex characters.
