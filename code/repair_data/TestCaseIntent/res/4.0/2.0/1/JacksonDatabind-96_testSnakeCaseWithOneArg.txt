Intent: The test case `testSnakeCaseWithOneArg` is intended to validate that the JSON deserialization process correctly maps a JSON property with a snake_case name (`param_name0`) to a corresponding Java object field (presumably `paramName0`) using a single-argument constructor in the `OneProperty` class. This test checks if the deserialization respects naming strategies such as converting snake_case to camelCase.

Repair strategy: Investigate and possibly adjust the implementation of naming strategy handling in the deserialization process to ensure that snake_case JSON properties are correctly mapped to camelCase Java object fields. This may involve modifying the logic that determines whether a parameter name from JSON should be treated as explicit and ensuring that naming strategies (like snake_case to camelCase) are correctly applied during the deserialization process. Check if the naming strategy is being correctly applied when determining `useProps` and ensure that `paramName` is correctly derived from the JSON input and matches the expected Java field name.
