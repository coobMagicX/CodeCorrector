Intent: The purpose of the test case `testEscapedCharacter()` is to verify that the `Lexer` correctly handles and processes an escape sequence in a string. It checks whether the lexer can accurately maintain the escape character followed by a character that doesn't correspond to any known escape sequence (in this case, `\a`), thereby expecting the output to retain the literal characters as part of the token content.

Repair strategy: The source code in the `readEscape()` method should be modified to properly handle unrecognized escape sequences by returning the escape character followed by the subsequent character as a valid output. This can be achieved by adding a condition to return the escape character combined with the unrecognized character, thus ensuring that the lexer does not discard or misinterpret sequences that are not part of the standard set (e.g., `\r`, `\n`, `\t`, etc.). Modify the default case in the switch statement to handle and return unrecognized escape sequences correctly.
