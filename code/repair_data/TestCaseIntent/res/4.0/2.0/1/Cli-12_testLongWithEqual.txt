Intent: The primary intent of the test case `testLongWithEqual` is to verify the correct parsing of command line arguments when using the GNU-style long options with values specified using an equals sign (e.g., `--foo=bar`). The test checks whether the parser correctly interprets `--foo=bar` as the option `foo` with the associated value `bar`.

Repair strategy: From the failure in the test case, it is likely that the `flatten` method does not correctly handle the scenario where an option and its value are passed together with an equals sign (e.g., `--foo=bar`). The method should be modified to detect when an option is followed by an equals sign and correctly split the option from its value before adding them to the tokens list. This will ensure that the parser can recognize and retrieve the option and its corresponding value correctly. Specifically, the current handling inside the `else if (arg.startsWith("-"))` block needs refinement to check for and correctly process `=` within the argument. This includes splitting the argument into the option name and the value, and ensuring these are added to the tokens list in a way that the parser can understand them as linked.
