Intent: The test case `testCustomMapValueDeser735` is intended to verify that the custom value deserializer behaves correctly for different mappings within a JSON object. Specifically, it assesses whether `map1` and `map2` within the JSON string are deserialized properly using potentially different deserializers or settings, and whether these mappings reflect the expected transformed values correctly in the deserialized object.

Repair strategy: The failure of the test at the specified assertion suggests that the deserialization process might not be applying the correct or intended deserialization logic for `map2`. The issue likely resides in how the deserializers are managed and applied during the deserialization process. To address this:

1. Ensure that custom deserializers, if specified, are correctly associated with the corresponding map entries in the object. This might involve checking the configuration or annotations that link deserializers to map properties.
   
2. Verify and modify the implementation of the deserialization process to correctly distinguish and apply appropriate deserializers for `map1` and `map2`. This may involve debugging the deserializer selection logic to ensure it correctly identifies and applies custom deserializers based on the structure or annotations in the `TestMapBean735` class.

3. If the method `isCachable()` influences the caching and reuse of deserializers, review its logic to confirm that it correctly identifies scenarios where caching should be prevented (such as when custom deserializers are in use) to avoid inappropriate reuse of deserializers that might not be suitable for all contexts in the JSON data. Adjust the conditions in `isCachable()` if necessary to ensure that caching does not interfere with the use of custom deserializers.
