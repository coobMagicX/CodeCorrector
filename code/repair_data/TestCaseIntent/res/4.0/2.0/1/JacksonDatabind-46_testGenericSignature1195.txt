Intent: The purpose of the test case `testGenericSignature1195` is to validate the correctness of the method `getGenericSignature(StringBuilder sb)` in constructing the generic signature string for various generic return types of methods, including lists, maps, and atomic references. It aims to ensure that the function accurately captures the type information and formats it according to the JVMâ€™s signature notation for generic types.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that there's an issue with how the method handles the depth or complexity of nested generics, particularly with types like `AtomicReference<T>`. The error could be originating from incorrect appending of type delimiters (`<` and `;`) or mishandling nested type parameters in `_classSignature` or `_referencedType.getGenericSignature(sb)`. To repair this, the source code should be reviewed and possibly refactored to ensure proper recursive handling and formatting of nested generic types. Checking and revising the logic inside `_referencedType.getGenericSignature(sb)` for accuracy in representing nested types would be a critical direction for the repair. This could involve enhancing the recursive traversal capabilities of the signature construction logic or refining how type boundaries are marked in the string builder.
