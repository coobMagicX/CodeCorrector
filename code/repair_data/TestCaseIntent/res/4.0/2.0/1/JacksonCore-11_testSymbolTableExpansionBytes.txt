Intent: The test case `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` is likely intended to verify that the symbol table expands correctly when handling byte array inputs. This is crucial for ensuring that the system can dynamically adjust its storage capacity to accommodate varying sizes and amounts of data inputs.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the `_testSymbolTableExpansion` method to ensure that it correctly tests the capacity expansion of the symbol table under byte array operations. Specifically, check mechanisms within `_verifySharing` and `rehash` methods to ensure they handle byte arrays correctly and trigger expansion as needed. Ensure that the `_hashArea` and `_names` arrays are expanded and rehashed properly when `_hashShared` is true, and verify that `_needRehash` appropriately flags when a rehash is necessary. Adjustments may also be needed in how the expansion and rehashing are triggered or in how the test validates the outcomes.
