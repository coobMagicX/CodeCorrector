Intent:
The test case `testNoHeaderMap` is intended to verify that the method `getHeaderMap` returns `null` when no headers are defined in a CSV file parsed by the `CSVParser`. The CSV data "a,b,c\n1,2,3\nx,y,z" is used in the test, which appears to have headers, implying that the method should not return headers if they are not explicitly defined as such.

Repair strategy:
The main issue seems to be that the method `getHeaderMap()` is returning an empty map instead of `null` when there are no explicit headers set in the CSV file. To repair this:
1. Modify the `getHeaderMap` method to check if the headers are explicitly defined for the CSV format used during parsing. If headers are not defined, the method should return `null`.
2. Check how the `CSVParser` constructor or the method that initializes `headerMap` is implemented. Ensure that `headerMap` is set to `null` when no headers are present or not defined in the CSV format.
3. Adjust the logic in `CSVParser` or related classes to differentiate between no headers and headers that are simply the first row of data, based on the CSV format settings. This will ensure that `getHeaderMap` behaves correctly in returning `null` when appropriate.
