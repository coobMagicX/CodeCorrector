Intent: The test case `testSkipValue_emptyJsonObject` is intended to verify that the `skipValue` method correctly handles an empty JSON object by advancing the reader to `JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT`, confirming that there are no values to skip and the document ends cleanly.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `skipValue` assumes that there will always be a value or name to skip, indicated by the conditional checks and manual stack manipulation. This logic fails with an empty JSON object because there is nothing to pop from the stack or increment. The repair should involve adding a check at the beginning of the `skipValue` method to handle the scenario where the JSON object is empty. This could include checking if `stackSize` is 1 (assuming the last remaining element in the stack is the empty JSON object) and directly setting the peek to `JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT`, bypassing other operations that manipulate the stack or path indices.
