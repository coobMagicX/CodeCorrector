Intent: The test case `testCOMPRESS335` aims to ensure that the method `getStreamFor` correctly opens a TAR file and returns an instance of `TarArchiveInputStream`, which is crucial for correctly handling TAR archive files in the application.

Repair strategy: Investigate the `getStreamFor` method to ensure that it properly identifies and opens TAR files, returning the correct type of stream (`TarArchiveInputStream`). Verify the method handles file paths and input stream initialization correctly. This could involve checking the file path resolution, ensuring the stream is correctly instantiated with the file contents, and confirming that the file format is correctly recognized and processed by the application. If the test fails due to file not found or class cast issues, ensure that the file path provided is accessible and correct in the test environment, and that the `getStreamFor` method is correctly casting the input stream to `TarArchiveInputStream`.
