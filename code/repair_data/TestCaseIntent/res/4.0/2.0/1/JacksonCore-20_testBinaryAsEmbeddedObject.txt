Intent: The `testBinaryAsEmbeddedObject` test case intends to validate that the `writeEmbeddedObject` method can correctly serialize binary data (in this case, a byte array) into a Base64 encoded string and write this correctly into both a StringWriter and a ByteArrayOutputStream.

Repair strategy: Modify the `writeEmbeddedObject` method in the source code to remove the exception throwing and instead implement functionality to check if the input object is a byte array (or other supported embedded object types). If it is a byte array, encode the array into a Base64 string and write it to the output stream. This will involve using Base64 encoding utilities and managing output stream writing based on the object's type and content. Ensure that the method supports other embedded object types as required by the application's context.
