Intent: The test case `readOfLength0ShouldReturn0` is intended to verify that when attempting to read 0 bytes into a buffer from a stream, the method should return 0, indicating that no bytes were read and no error occurred.

Repair strategy: Modify the `read` method to immediately return 0 when the parameter `len` is 0, before any other checks or operations are performed. This change ensures that the method adheres to the expected behavior of returning 0 when asked to read 0 bytes, which is a common edge case in I/O operations.
