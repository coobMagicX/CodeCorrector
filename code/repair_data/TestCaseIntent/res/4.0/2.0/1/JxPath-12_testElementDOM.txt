Intent: The intent of the failing test case 'testElementDOM' is to validate the correctness of the `testNode` function when handling a DOM element model. The test checks if the function can accurately determine whether a given node in a DOM model passes specified conditions (tests).

Repair strategy: Since the provided source code snippet is focused on determining the correctness of node processing based on various node types and conditions, and specific details of `doTestElement` including how it interacts with `testNode` are not available, the key repair direction would involve:
1. Ensuring that `testNode` function handles all node types correctly as per the DOM model specifications.
2. Verifying and possibly updating conditional checks within the `testNode` method to ensure that all node types and conditions specific to elements in the DOM model are correctly evaluated.
3. Debugging the `doTestElement` method to ensure that it sets up the test conditions correctly and passes the correct types of nodes and tests into `testNode`.
4. Adding or updating test conditions within `testElementDOM` to cover a wider range of scenarios for nodes within a DOM model to ensure robust testing of the `testNode` function.
