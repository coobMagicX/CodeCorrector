Intent: The test case `testEightEmptyFiles` likely aims to test the `writeBits` method's ability to handle a scenario where it needs to process and write out bit information for a collection of empty files (or data inputs). The test checks if the method can correctly handle and output bits when the input length is zero, ensuring no erroneous bits are written and possibly validating that no unnecessary writes occur.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the method `writeBits` efficiently handles cases where the length of the bitset is zero. This involves checking the logic in the loop and the final conditional write. Specifically, adjust the code to not perform any writes if the length is zero, and ensure correct reset of variables like `cache` and `shift` when no actual bits are processed. This might involve adding an initial condition to bypass the loop and the final write if `length` is zero or ensuring correct behavior inside the loop and conditional write logic at the end.
