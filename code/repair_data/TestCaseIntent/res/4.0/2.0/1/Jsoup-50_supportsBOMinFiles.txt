Intent: The test case "supportsBOMinFiles" is designed to verify that the `parseByteData` function correctly handles files with different types of Byte Order Marks (BOMs) and ensures that the document is parsed using the correct character encoding specified by the BOM. This ensures proper parsing and display of characters, especially from languages with non-Latin scripts.

Repair strategy: Update the `parseByteData` function to properly detect and handle different types of BOMs such as UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. This may involve checking the initial bytes of the ByteBuffer to identify the BOM and set the correct charset for decoding the document. Ensure that after detecting the BOM, the byte buffer is adjusted to skip the BOM bytes, and the correct charset is used for the subsequent decoding process. This will likely involve expanding the condition that checks for the presence of a BOM and includes logic to handle different BOM types beyond the current handling, which seems to default to `defaultCharset`.
