Intent: The test case `normalizesDiscordantTags` is intended to verify that the parser correctly handles and normalizes mismatched HTML tag cases, ensuring that tags are closed properly even if the closing tag has a different case (i.e., mismatch between `<div>` and `</DIV>`).

Repair strategy: The source of the problem likely lies within the `popStackToClose` method, which is supposed to manage the stack of HTML elements being parsed. The error could be due to case-sensitive comparison or improper handling of the stack when mismatched tags are encountered. The repair strategy should include:
1. Ensuring that tag comparison in `popStackToClose` is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic to ignore case differences.
2. Reviewing the logic used to manipulate the stack in `popStackToClose` to ensure that it correctly processes and removes elements up to the matched tag, even when case mismatches occur. This might involve correcting how elements are removed from the stack or verifying that the correct elements are being targeted for removal.
