Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the behavior of the `getLineNumber()` method in the `CSVParser` class. Specifically, it is testing the line number count when the line separator is set to "\r" (carriage return).

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on correctly counting the line number when the line separator is "\r". Currently, the code increments the line counter only when the current character is '\n'. The repair direction should address this limitation and ensure that the line counter is incremented correctly for each line, regardless of the line separator.
