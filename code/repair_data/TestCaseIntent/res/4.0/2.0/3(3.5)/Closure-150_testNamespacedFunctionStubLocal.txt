Intent: The failed test case is testing if a namespaced function is being stubbed correctly. It is checking if the "goog" object has a property called "foo" and if the property type is correctly set.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to ensure that the "goog" object has the property "foo" and that its type is correctly set to "function (number): ?".
