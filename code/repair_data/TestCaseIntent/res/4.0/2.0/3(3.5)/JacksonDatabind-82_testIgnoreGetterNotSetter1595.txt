Intent: The purpose of the failed test case is to verify that the "name" property is ignored during deserialization.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to ignore the "name" property during deserialization. This can be achieved by adding the "name" property to the list of ignored properties in the "builder.addIgnorable(propName)" section of the code.
