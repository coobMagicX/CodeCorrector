Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify the behavior of the "head" method when an undeclared namespace is used as a local name.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve updating the "head" method to handle undeclared namespaces correctly. This could include checking if the prefix is present in the namespacesStack and handling the case when it is not declared.
