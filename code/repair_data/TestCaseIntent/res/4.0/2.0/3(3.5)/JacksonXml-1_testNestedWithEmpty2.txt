Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the `vehicleActivity` list in the `VehicleMonitoringDelivery` object contains one entry.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the source code to ensure that an empty `VehicleActivity` object is added to the `vehicleActivity` list in the `VehicleMonitoringDelivery` object instead of not adding any object. This will ensure that the size of the `vehicleActivity` list is 1.
