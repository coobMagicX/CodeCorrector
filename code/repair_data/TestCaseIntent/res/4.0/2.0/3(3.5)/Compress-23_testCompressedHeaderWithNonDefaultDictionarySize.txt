Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the decoding of a compressed file with a non-default dictionary size.

Repair strategy: The code that is being tested is responsible for decoding a compressed file. The failure is likely due to an issue in the decoding process. The repair direction should focus on identifying and fixing any errors in the decoding logic.
