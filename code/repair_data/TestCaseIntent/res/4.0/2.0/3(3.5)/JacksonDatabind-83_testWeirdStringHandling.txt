Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the handling of weird strings during deserialization. Specifically, it tests the behavior when deserializing a string that is not a valid UUID.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this code is to modify the `_deserialize` method to handle the case when the input text is not a valid UUID. Instead of throwing an exception, it should return `null`. This change will allow the test case to pass and ensure that the code can handle weird strings gracefully.
