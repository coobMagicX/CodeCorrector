Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `parseOctal` method in the `TarUtils` class. The test cases are checking if the method correctly parses octal values from a byte array.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the parsing of octal values in the `parseOctal` method. There seem to be issues with handling leading spaces, trailing NULs and spaces, and converting the ASCII representation of octal digits to their integer values.
