Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the functionality of the BinaryEncoder class in the Base64 implementation. It aims to verify that the encoded binary data matches the expected Base64 representation.

Repair strategy: The repair direction to fix the failing test case is to investigate and address the issue causing the assertion to fail. This could involve debugging the Base64 encoding logic to ensure it produces the correct Base64 representation for the given binary data.
