Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the constructor of the DocumentType class when all the input parameters (name, publicId, systemId, and baseUri) are empty strings.

Repair strategy: To fix the failing test case, the constructor should be modified to handle the case when the name, publicId, systemId, and baseUri parameters are empty strings. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the constructor to check if any of the input parameters are empty and handle it accordingly.
