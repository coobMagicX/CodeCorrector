Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the parsing of ISO8601 formatted dates with partial milliseconds.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly parse and handle ISO8601 formatted dates with partial milliseconds. This may involve adding support for parsing and handling partial milliseconds in the source code.
