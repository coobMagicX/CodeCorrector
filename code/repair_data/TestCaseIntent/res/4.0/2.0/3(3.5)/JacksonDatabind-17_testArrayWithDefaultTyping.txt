Intent: The failed test case is testing the behavior of reading a JSON array using default typing with an ObjectMapper object. The intent is to ensure that the ObjectMapper correctly parses the JSON array and returns a JsonNode object representing the array.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to investigate and fix the issue with reading JSON arrays using default typing. The code should be modified to correctly parse and handle JSON arrays.
