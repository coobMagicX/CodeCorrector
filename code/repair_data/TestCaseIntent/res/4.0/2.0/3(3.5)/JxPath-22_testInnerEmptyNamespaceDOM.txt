Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the method `getNamespaceURI` with an inner node that has an empty namespace.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this failed test case would be to modify the source code to handle the case of an inner node with an empty namespace correctly. This could involve checking for an empty namespace and returning the correct value in such cases.
