Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that the `readValue` method in the `ObjectMapper` class correctly deserializes a JSON string into a `Foo` object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy would involve investigating the cause of the `NullPointerException` that is causing the test case to fail. It is likely that the `generateId` method is not properly handling the case where the `forPojo` parameter is null. The repair direction would be to modify the `generateId` method to handle null inputs and return an appropriate value.
