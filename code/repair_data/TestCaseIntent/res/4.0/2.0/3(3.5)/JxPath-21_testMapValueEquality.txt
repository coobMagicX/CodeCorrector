Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the equality and inequality of values in a map.

Repair strategy: Based on the failed test cases, it seems that the "!=" and "=" operators are not functioning correctly for comparing map values. The repair direction would be to investigate and fix the implementation of these operators in the code.
