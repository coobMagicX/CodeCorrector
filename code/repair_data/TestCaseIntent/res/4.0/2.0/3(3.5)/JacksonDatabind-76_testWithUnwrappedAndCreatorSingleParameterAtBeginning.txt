Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to deserialize a JSON string into a Person object and verify that the deserialized object has the correct values for the properties.

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to correctly deserialize the "first_name" property of the JSON string and assign it to the corresponding property in the Person object.
