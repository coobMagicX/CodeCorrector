Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the type of the variable "out" matches the expected type "{prop: (string|undefined)}".

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve modifying the "matchConstraint" method to handle the case where the constraint object is a record type. This can be done by implementing the "matchRecordTypeConstraint" method to iterate over each property on the record and try to match properties on the current object.
