Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to check if an error is reported when a typedef is used as the type of the "this" object in a function declaration.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue would involve handling the error correctly when the type of "this" does not resolve to an ObjectType. The code should be modified to handle the case where the typeOfThis variable is not an ObjectType, possibly by throwing an appropriate error message.
