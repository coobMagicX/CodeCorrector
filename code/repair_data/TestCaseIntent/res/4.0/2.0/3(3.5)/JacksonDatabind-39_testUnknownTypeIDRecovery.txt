Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of deserialization when encountering unknown subtypes. The test cases aim to ensure that the deserialization process handles unknown subtypes correctly and recovers from errors.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code should be to properly handle unknown subtypes during deserialization. This can be achieved by implementing logic to handle unknown subtypes and recover from errors gracefully.
