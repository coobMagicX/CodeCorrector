Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that if the specified charset cannot be encoded, the code should fallback to using UTF-8.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code to handle cases where the specified charset cannot be encoded. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the charset is encodable before using it. If it is not encodable, the code should fallback to using UTF-8.
