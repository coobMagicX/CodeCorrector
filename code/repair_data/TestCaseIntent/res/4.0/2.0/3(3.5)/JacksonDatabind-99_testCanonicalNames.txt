Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the `toCanonical()` method of the `JavaType` class returns the correct canonical name for various types.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly build the canonical names for types. The repair strategy would involve fixing the logic in the `buildCanonicalName()` method to handle generic types and parameterized types correctly.
