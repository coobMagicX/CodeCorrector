Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to check if a date object is serialized correctly without a pattern.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve modifying the `createContextual` method to correctly handle the case when the shape is `STRING` and there is no pattern specified. The method should use the default `StdDateFormat` instead of creating a new `SimpleDateFormat` with a custom pattern.
