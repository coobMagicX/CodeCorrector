Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the functionality of the `parseOctal` method in the `TarUtils` class. The test cases cover different scenarios such as parsing octal values, handling leading spaces, and trimming trailing NULs and spaces.

Repair strategy: Based on the failed test cases, it seems that the `parseOctal` method is not correctly handling the trimming of trailing NULs and spaces. The test cases where the buffer ends with a NUL or space are failing. To pass these test cases, the code needs to be repaired to correctly trim the trailing NULs and spaces before parsing the octal value.
