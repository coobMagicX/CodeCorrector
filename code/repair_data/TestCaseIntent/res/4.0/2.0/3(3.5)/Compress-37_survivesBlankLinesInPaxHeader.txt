Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to check if the method can correctly parse the Pax headers in a tar archive file that contains blank lines.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to handle blank lines in the Pax headers. Currently, the code does not have any logic to handle blank lines, which may cause issues in parsing the headers correctly. The repair strategy would involve adding a condition to skip blank lines during header parsing.
