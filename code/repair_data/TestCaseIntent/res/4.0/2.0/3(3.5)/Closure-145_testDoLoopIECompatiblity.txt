Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the "isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo" function when it is applied to various input scenarios involving do-while loops within if statements.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the failing test cases is to modify the "isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo" function to correctly handle the presence of do-while loops within if statements. This may involve checking for the specific syntax of do-while loops within if statements and returning the appropriate result.
