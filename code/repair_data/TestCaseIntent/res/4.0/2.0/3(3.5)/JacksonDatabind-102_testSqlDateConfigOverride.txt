Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the configured format override for java.sql.Date is correctly applied during serialization.

Repair strategy: The source code should be updated to correctly handle the format override for java.sql.Date. This can be achieved by modifying the "createContextual" method to check for java.sql.Date specifically and apply the configured format override.
