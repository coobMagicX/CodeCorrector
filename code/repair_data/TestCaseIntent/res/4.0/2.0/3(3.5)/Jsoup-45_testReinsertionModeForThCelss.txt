Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that after parsing the given HTML body, the document body contains only one child element.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the logic in the `resetInsertionMode()` method to correctly handle the insertion mode transitions based on the current node's name. Specifically, the issue lies in the condition for the "td" element, where it is checking if the name is "td" twice instead of checking if the name is "td" and the current node is not the last node.
