Intent: The purpose of the failing test case is to verify that the adapter correctly handles null values when converting from JSON to a Date object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code in the `read` method to handle the case when the input JSON is "null". Currently, the code throws a JsonParseException when the input is not a string, so we need to add a check for the "null" value and return null in that case.
