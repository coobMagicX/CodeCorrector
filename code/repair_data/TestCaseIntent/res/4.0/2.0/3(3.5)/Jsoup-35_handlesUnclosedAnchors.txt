Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the code correctly handles unclosed anchor tags.

Repair strategy: One possible repair strategy is to modify the code to handle unclosed anchor tags by automatically closing them when necessary. This can be done by checking if an anchor tag is in scope when encountering a new anchor tag. If it is, the previous anchor tag should be closed before processing the new one.
