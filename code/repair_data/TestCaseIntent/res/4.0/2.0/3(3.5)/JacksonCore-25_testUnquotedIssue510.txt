Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that an exception is thrown when parsing an invalid JSON input.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the parsing logic to correctly handle the invalid input. Specifically, the code should handle the case when the input pointer (_inputPtr) reaches the end of the input buffer (_inputEnd) without encountering a valid character.
