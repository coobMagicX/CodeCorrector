Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify that the code can correctly parse HTML files with different byte order marks (BOM) and extract the correct title and text content.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the code is to fix the logic for detecting and handling the byte order mark (BOM) in the input HTML files. The code should correctly determine the charset based on the BOM and decode the byte data accordingly. Additionally, the code should correctly parse the input HTML and extract the title and text content.
