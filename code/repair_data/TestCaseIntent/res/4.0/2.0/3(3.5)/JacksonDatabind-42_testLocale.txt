Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the deserialization of Locale objects from a JSON string representation. The test cases include different variations of Locale strings to verify the correctness of the deserialization process.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle the deserialization of an empty string for Locale objects. Currently, when an empty string is passed, the method returns the result of the superclass's deserialization, which does not handle the empty string case correctly. The repair strategy would involve adding a conditional statement to handle the empty string case specifically for Locale deserialization.
