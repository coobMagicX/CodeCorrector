Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the `parseOctal` method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when the input is invalid.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the cases where the input is not valid and ensuring that the method throws the `IllegalArgumentException` as expected. Specifically, the code should be modified to handle the cases where the input length is less than 2, and where the input contains invalid characters such as spaces, NUL characters, or characters outside the range of '0' to '7'. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the input is an empty byte array.
