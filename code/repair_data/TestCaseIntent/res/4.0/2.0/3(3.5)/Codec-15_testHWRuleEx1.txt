Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the HW rule check in the `getMappingCode` method. The HW rule should return 0 if certain conditions are met.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the HW rule check in the `getMappingCode` method. This can be done by identifying the conditions that need to be met for the HW rule to return 0 and ensuring that those conditions are correctly checked in the code.
