Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the code when the "multipleMatches" parameter is set to false.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to ensure that when the "multipleMatches" parameter is set to false, the code correctly returns the first matching value and ignores any subsequent matches.
