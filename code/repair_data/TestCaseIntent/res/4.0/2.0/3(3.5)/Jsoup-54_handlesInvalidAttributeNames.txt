Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the handling of invalid attribute names in the copyAttributes() method.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the copyAttributes() method to properly handle invalid attribute names. This could include validating the attribute names against the valid XML attribute name pattern and either discarding or modifying the invalid attribute names accordingly.
