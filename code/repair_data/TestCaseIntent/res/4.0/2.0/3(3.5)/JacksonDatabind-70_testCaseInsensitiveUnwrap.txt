Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to check if the ObjectMapper can successfully deserialize an empty JSON object into a Person object when the ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES feature is enabled.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to handle the case when there are no properties in the JSON object being deserialized. Currently, the code throws a NoSuchElementException if no entry is found. The repair direction would be to add a check to handle the case when no properties are found and return an empty Person object instead of throwing an exception.
