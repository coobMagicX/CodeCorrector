Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to deserialize a JSON string into an object of type WithBagOfStrings and verify that the deserialized object has the correct number of strings.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to ensure that the JSON string is correctly deserialized into the WithBagOfStrings object. This may involve checking the deserialization logic and ensuring that the strings are properly parsed and added to the object's list.
