Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `getBinaryValue()` method for different lengths and types of encoded input data.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on identifying and fixing the issue that is causing the test cases to fail. This may involve investigating the exception message and determining why the method is unable to retrieve the binary value.
