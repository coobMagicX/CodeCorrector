Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the "inSmall" field of the SmallClass object is correctly deserialized from the given JSON.

Repair strategy: The fault-revealing line suggests that there might be an issue with accessing the "inBig" map and retrieving the "key" list. The repair direction would be to investigate the deserialization of the "inBig" map and ensure that the "key" list is being correctly populated.
