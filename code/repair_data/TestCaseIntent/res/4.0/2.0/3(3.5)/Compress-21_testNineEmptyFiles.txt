Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the "writeBits" method with the scenario of compressing 9 empty files.

Repair strategy: The potential error in the source code is related to the calculation of the "shift" variable. The "shift" variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration, but it is not reset to 7 when it reaches 0. This can cause incorrect bit shifting and lead to incorrect results. The repair strategy would be to reset the "shift" variable to 7 after the condition "shift == 0" is true.
