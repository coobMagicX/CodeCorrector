Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the `hasClass` method of the given source code. The test cases aim to check if the method correctly identifies the presence of a class name in an element's attribute, regardless of case sensitivity.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code should involve fixing the case-insensitivity issue in the `hasClass` method. The method should compare the class name with the attribute value while disregarding the case. This can be achieved by converting both the class name and attribute value to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.
