Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that the "isDirectory" method correctly identifies a directory when the file name ends with a slash ("/").

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the "isDirectory" method to correctly identify directories when the file name ends with a slash ("/"). This can be done by adding a condition to check if the file name ends with a slash ("/") and returning true.
