Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to check if the code correctly handles nested generic types.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code to correctly handle nested generic types. This may involve updating the constructSpecializedType() method in the TypeFactory class to handle the nested generic types.
