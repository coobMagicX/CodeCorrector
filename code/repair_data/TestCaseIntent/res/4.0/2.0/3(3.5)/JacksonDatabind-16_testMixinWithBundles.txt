Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that when a mix-in annotation is added to the ObjectMapper, the resulting JSON output is as expected.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve investigating why the expected JSON output is not being generated correctly. This could involve checking if the mix-in annotation is being applied correctly or if there is an issue with the serialization process.
