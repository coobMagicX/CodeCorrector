Intent: The intent and purpose of the failing test case is to check whether the parsing of the HTML document preserves the case sensitivity of the tags.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code to ensure that the case sensitivity of the tags is preserved during parsing. This may require making changes to the logic that handles the comparison of tag names.
