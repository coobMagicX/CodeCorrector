Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that when the "Outer" object is serialized using the ObjectMapper, the resulting JSON string contains the "animal" property with the value "Zebra", but does not contain the "inner" property.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve ensuring that the "inner" property is not included in the serialized JSON string. This could potentially be achieved by modifying the serialization logic to exclude the "inner" property from the output.
