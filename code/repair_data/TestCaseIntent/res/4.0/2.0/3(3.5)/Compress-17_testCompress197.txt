Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the code is able to handle a specific scenario related to TarArchiveInputStream.

Repair strategy: The failed test case is not directly related to the parseOctal method. The repair strategy should focus on identifying and fixing the issue in the test case rather than the parseOctal method.
