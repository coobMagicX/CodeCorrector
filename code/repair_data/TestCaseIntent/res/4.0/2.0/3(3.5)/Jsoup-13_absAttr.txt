Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the functionality of the "hasAttr" method in the source code. It checks whether the attribute key exists in the attributes of a given document.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to modify the "hasAttr" method implementation so that it properly checks whether the attribute key exists in the document's attributes. There may be a bug in the current implementation that is causing the test cases to fail.
