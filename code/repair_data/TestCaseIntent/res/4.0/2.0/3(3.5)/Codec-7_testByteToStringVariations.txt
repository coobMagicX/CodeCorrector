Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `encodeBase64String` method in the `Base64` class. The test cases cover different scenarios such as encoding a byte array to a Base64 string, handling empty byte arrays, handling null byte arrays, and encoding a UUID.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue in the `encodeBase64String` method that is causing the test case to fail. The direction for the repair could be to investigate why the `encodeBase64String` method is not returning the expected result for the given input byte array.
