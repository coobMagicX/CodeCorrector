Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the code properly handles the presence of "<" and ">" characters within a <script> tag by converting them to a comment.

Repair strategy: The code needs to be modified to handle the "<" and ">" characters within a <script> tag by converting them to a comment. This can be achieved by updating the parsing logic to correctly handle these characters.
