Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the byte offset, line number, and column number of the current token and token location after feeding input to the parser.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on ensuring that the byte offset, line number, and column number are correctly calculated and updated when feeding input to the parser. The issue may lie in the calculation of these values in the source code.
