Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the code when non-finite double values (NaN, positive and negative infinity) are passed to the `value()` method of the `JsonWriter` class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling the non-finite double values (NaN, positive and negative infinity) in a way that they are correctly written to the output without causing any exceptions. This can be done by modifying the `value()` method to check for non-finite values and handle them appropriately.
