Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that fields after the last creator property in the JSON input are correctly deserialized and assigned to the corresponding fields in the target object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on ensuring that the fields after the last creator property are properly deserialized and assigned to the target object. This may involve modifying the deserialization logic to handle the fields in the correct order and ensure that their values are correctly assigned to the corresponding fields in the target object.
