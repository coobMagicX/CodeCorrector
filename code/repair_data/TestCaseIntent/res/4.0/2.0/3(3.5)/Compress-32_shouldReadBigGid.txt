Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the `getLongGroupId()` method returns the correct group ID when a big group ID is set on the `TarArchiveEntry` object.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle big group IDs correctly. Currently, the code does not have any logic to handle big group IDs, which is causing the test case to fail. The repair direction is to update the `applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry` method to handle big group IDs.
