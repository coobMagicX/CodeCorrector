Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the "hasAttr" method in the source code. Specifically, the test is checking whether the method correctly identifies if an element has a specific attribute.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to update the "hasAttr" method to correctly handle the attribute key with the "abs:" prefix. The method should consider the "abs:" prefix when checking for the attribute and return the correct result.
