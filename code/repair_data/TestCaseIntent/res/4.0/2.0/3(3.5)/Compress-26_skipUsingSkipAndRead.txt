Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the `skip` method by providing a custom implementation of `InputStream` through the `StreamWrapper` class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the failed test case could be to fix the custom implementation of `InputStream` in the `StreamWrapper` class so that it properly skips the desired number of bytes.
