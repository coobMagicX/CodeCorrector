Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the encoding and decoding of an empty byte array using the "testByteByByte" method.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the encoding and decoding logic for an empty byte array. Currently, it seems that the code is not handling the case of an empty byte array properly, leading to the test case failure. The encoding logic should be modified to handle the case of an empty byte array and produce the expected encoded output.
