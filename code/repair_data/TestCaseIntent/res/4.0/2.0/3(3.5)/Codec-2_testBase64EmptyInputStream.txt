Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `encode` method when given an empty input stream.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the case of an empty input stream correctly. Currently, the code does not handle this case, which causes the test cases to fail. The repair direction should include adding a check for an empty input stream and handling it appropriately to pass the test cases.
