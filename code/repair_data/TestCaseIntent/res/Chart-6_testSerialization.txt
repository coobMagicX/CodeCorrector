Intent: The test case `testSerialization` is intended to verify that a `ShapeList` instance can be serialized and then deserialized back into an equivalent object, confirming that the serialization process preserves the state and content of the `ShapeList` object correctly.

Repair strategy: The existing `equals` method in `ShapeList` class uses `super.equals(obj)` which typically checks for reference equality and does not check for content equality of the lists. To make the test pass, the `equals` method needs to be modified to perform a deep equality check on the contents of the `ShapeList`. Specifically, the method should iterate through each shape in the list, comparing them for equality. Additionally, handle null values gracefully during comparison since one of the shapes is explicitly set to null in the test case. Ensure that both `ShapeList` objects have the same shapes in the same order for the method to return true.
