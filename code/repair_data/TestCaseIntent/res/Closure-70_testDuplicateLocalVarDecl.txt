Intent: The intent of the test case "testDuplicateLocalVarDecl" is to check the behavior of the code when a local variable is declared with the same name as a function parameter but with a different type, ensuring that the system correctly handles type inconsistencies and variable shadowing within the same scope.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the `declareArguments` method to handle cases where a local variable is declared with the same name as a function parameter within the same function scope. This could involve adding logic to detect and handle name clashes between parameters and local variable declarations, possibly by maintaining a map or list to track declared identifiers within the scope. Also, ensuring that type mismatches between such declarations are flagged appropriately would be crucial. This might include extending the `defineSlot` method or the structures it interacts with to better manage scope and type conflicts.
