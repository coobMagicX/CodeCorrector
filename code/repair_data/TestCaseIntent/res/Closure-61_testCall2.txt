Intent:
The purpose of this test case, `testCall2()`, is to verify that the function `functionCallHasSideEffects` correctly identifies and handles expressions involving built-in functions that do not have side effects, such as `Math.sin(0)`. The test seems designed to check if the function can assess that the call to `Math.sin` does not produce side effects and thus simplifies the expression "1 + Math.sin(0);" to "" as part of an optimization or transformation process.

Repair strategy:
1. Review how the function `functionCallHasSideEffects` interprets the `Math.sin` method. Ensure that the function identifies calls to `Math` methods as having no side effects, particularly when these methods are invoked directly on the `Math` object without any intermediate properties.
2. Amend the logic under the `Token.GETPROP` condition to better handle cases where the object from which properties are being retrieved is `Math`. This could involve adding a specific check to see if the base object of a `GETPROP` node is the `Math` object and if the method invoked is recognized as one without side effects.
3. Ensure that the set `BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS_WITHOUT_SIDEEFFECTS` includes `Math.sin` or implement an additional check for methods under the `Math` namespace.
4. Validate the handling of nested property accesses and method calls to ensure that functions like `Math.sin` are correctly identified, irrespective of their syntactic structure in the code.
5. Consider enhancing the condition that checks `if (compiler != null && !compiler.hasRegExpGlobalReferences())` to separately handle cases where the method calls are on the `Math` object, which might not need to consider RegExp global references. 

By refining how property accesses and method invocations are evaluated, particularly for built-in objects like `Math`, the function can be corrected to pass the test by properly recognizing that `Math.sin(0)` has no side effects.
