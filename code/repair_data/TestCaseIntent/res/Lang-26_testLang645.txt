Intent: The test case `testLang645` is designed to verify that the `FastDateFormat` class correctly formats a specific date into a string that represents both the day of the week and the week number according to the Swedish locale ("sv", "SE"). The date being formatted is January 1, 2010, which should display as "fredag, week 53" in the specified format and locale.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `FastDateFormat` class correctly handles locale-specific week and day calculations. The issue might stem from improper locale handling or incorrect week calculations within the `FastDateFormat` class. The repair should focus on:
1. Verifying and adjusting the locale settings within the `FastDateFormat` to ensure they correctly influence the day of the week and week number calculations.
2. Checking the week calculation logic to confirm that it aligns with the ISO week date system, which is likely expected in this context, particularly since the first week of the year in some systems (including ISO) can be the last week of the previous year.
3. Ensuring the format string ("EEEE', week 'ww") is correctly interpreted in the context of the Swedish locale. Adjustments might be needed in the parsing logic of format strings to handle locale-specific week notations correctly.
