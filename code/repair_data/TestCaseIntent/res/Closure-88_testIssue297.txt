Intent:
The intent of the failing test case `testIssue297` is to verify the correct behavior of variable renaming and optimization in a JavaScript function during the `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation level. This involves checking that variable assignments within a complex logical expression are handled correctly, ensuring that the variable is properly tracked through its multiple reassignments and used correctly in subsequent conditions.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should focus on enhancing the `isVariableReadBeforeKill` function to accurately track the state of variables that are reassigned multiple times within a single expression. This involves ensuring that the function can differentiate between different uses of the variable, particularly in contexts where the variable is both a read and kill target within the same expression. The approach should include:
1. Modifying the function to better handle scenarios where a variable is reassigned and used in the same expression (e.g., `(x = p.id) && (x = parseInt(x.substr(1)))`).
2. Ensuring that the variable state transitions (from READ to KILL or vice versa) are appropriately captured within nested and complex expressions.
3. Reviewing the handling of short-circuit evaluation in logical expressions to ensure that variable states are updated correctly through each part of the expression.
4. Implementing additional checks or maintaining a state history to accurately reflect the variable's lifecycle within a single logical operation. 

These steps are vital to ensure the source code can accurately reflect variable usage and transitions, thus passing the given test case and similar scenarios.
