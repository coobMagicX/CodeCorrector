Intent: The intent of the test case `testBadInterfaceExtendsNonExistentInterfaces` is to verify that the system correctly handles and reports errors when an interface extends non-existent interfaces in JavaScript code. This is to ensure that meaningful error messages are provided for invalid type annotations.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a validation check for the existence of interfaces before attempting to access properties or methods on them. If an interface is non-existent, the code should generate and report a specific error message indicating the unknown or invalid interface type. This can be done by adding a check in the method `checkInterfaceConflictProperties` or earlier in the processing pipeline to catch and handle the case where `interfaceType` or `implicitProto` is null or invalid, thereby preventing further execution and errors related to non-existent objects.
