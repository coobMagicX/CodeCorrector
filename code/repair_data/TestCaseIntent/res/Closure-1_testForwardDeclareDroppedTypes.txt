Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify the behavior of the source code when handling JavaScript dependencies and parameter removal in functions. The tests check how the source code manages unused function arguments and dependencies among different JavaScript modules, ensuring appropriate function declaration modifications and error reporting.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to handle cases where function arguments might still be significant due to their type annotations (used for dependency management or type checking), even though they are not directly referenced within the function body. This implies:
1. Modifying the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method to consider the type annotations of function parameters when deciding whether to remove them. This may involve checking whether the type is provided or required within the project and retaining parameters that have significant type annotations related to dependency management.
2. Enhancing the method to ensure that type-related errors are handled gracefully, especially when type annotations are involved in the function parameters, thereby preventing the stripping of parameters that might cause a `TYPE_PARSE_ERROR`.
3. Ensuring that the function's arity (length property) is preserved or correctly updated in the context where type annotations indicate dependencies that must not be dropped, even in advanced optimization modes.
