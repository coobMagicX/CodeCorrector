Intent:
The intent of the test case `testExternalIssue1053` is to verify the behavior of the function `isAssignedOnceInLifetime()` when a variable is assigned within a function that is recursively called. The test seems to assess whether the function correctly identifies that the variable is assigned multiple times due to the recursion, which should technically mean it is being assigned in a loop-like manner.

Repair strategy:
To handle recursive function calls as loop-like structures in the context of assignments, the source code needs to be enhanced to detect recursion as a form of repetitive assignment. This can be achieved by analyzing the call stack or maintaining a record of already visited functions. If a function is called recursively, the variable assignment within should be treated akin to a loop, causing `isAssignedOnceInLifetime()` to return false. Hence, the repair direction should involve modifying the code to detect recursive functions and treat them similarly to loops in the context of variable assignment.
