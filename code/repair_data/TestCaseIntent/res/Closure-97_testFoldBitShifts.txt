Intent: The intent of the test case `fold("x = -1 >>> 0", "x = 4294967295"); // 0xffffffff` is to verify that the unsigned right shift operation (URSH) on a negative number is correctly computed to represent the unsigned 32-bit integer result in JavaScript, which treats negative numbers differently than Java for this operation.

Repair strategy: Modify the handling of URSH (`>>>`) in the source code to correctly compute the result as an unsigned 32-bit integer when applied to negative numbers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the cast to an integer (from double) retains the unsigned nature by using appropriate data types or methods that handle overflow and underflow correctly, such as using `long` or bitwise operations that simulate JavaScript's behavior in Java.
