Intent: The test cases aim to validate that the method `toLocale` correctly parses string inputs into proper `Locale` objects, handling special cases where locales are specified using underscores to delineate language, country, and variant. The method should handle edge cases where parts of the locale string are missing or improperly formatted.

Repair strategy: Modify the `toLocale` method to handle cases where the input string starts with an underscore. The current implementation assumes that the first two characters must be lowercase letters representing the language; however, test cases indicate that the method must also accept strings starting with an underscore followed by country codes or further specifications. The method should be updated to:
1. Check if the string starts with an underscore and then adjust parsing logic to skip the language part and directly interpret the subsequent characters as country codes or variants.
2. Implement checks for these scenarios to ensure proper parsing and validation of the country code and variant sections when the language part is absent or represented by an underscore.
