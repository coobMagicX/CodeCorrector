Intent: The test case `testGetMsgWiringNoWarnings` is intended to verify that the compiler handles internationalization (i18n) management appropriately without generating warnings when the `compilation_level` is set to `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`. Specifically, it checks that `goog.getMsg` related transformations are handled correctly, and no warnings are issued for i18n when no translations file is provided.

Repair strategy: The source code handling within `createOptions()` should ensure that when the `compilation_level` is set to `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` and no translations file is specified, the system should not only assign an `EmptyMessageBundle` but also appropriately configure the compiler to suppress i18n warnings. This can be achieved by adding a condition to set an option that disables these warnings under the specified conditions. Additionally, ensure that changes in message handling do not affect other functionalities negatively.
