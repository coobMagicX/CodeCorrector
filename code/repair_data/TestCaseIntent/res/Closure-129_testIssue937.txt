Intent: The test case `testIssue937` aims to validate the minification and type-casting functionalities of a JavaScript compiler. It checks whether a complex JavaScript expression involving a new object instantiation followed by a type-cast and method call is correctly minimized and that the type annotations are preserved properly after the compilation.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed to ensure proper handling of casts and method calls on newly created objects. Specifically, the `annotateCalls` method in the source code appears to focus on handling "this" context and direct eval calls but may not adequately address type-casts or property accesses (like `['abc']`) on new instances. The repair should involve:
1. Ensuring that the type information (`/** @type {function():!string} */`) is retained during and after the transformation.
2. Verifying and possibly enhancing the handling of property access (`['abc']`) on new object instances post instantiation and ensuring it transitions correctly during code minimization.
3. Checking the interaction between different node transformations (like casts and calls) to ensure they are correctly recognized and processed by the compiler optimization routines.
