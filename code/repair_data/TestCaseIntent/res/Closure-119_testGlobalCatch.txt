Intent: The test case `testGlobalCatch` is intended to verify the handling of exception objects within a `catch` block, specifically checking if the exception object `e` is correctly identified as a local variable and not treated as a global variable during logging in the console.

Repair strategy: Modify the `collect` method to handle the scope of variables declared within `catch` blocks more accurately. Ensure that variables declared in `catch` blocks are treated as local variables, regardless of their usage within the block. This can be achieved by enhancing the scope determination logic or by adding specific handling for `catch` blocks in the source code, ensuring that such variables do not erroneously get classified as global names.
