Intent: The test case is designed to check that the `processRequireCall` method correctly handles cases where a required namespace is not provided, and it should not incorrectly flag 'goog' as an undeclared variable when using the Closure Compiler pass.

Repair strategy: Review the handling of provided namespaces within the `processRequireCall` method to ensure correct identification and handling of missing namespaces. Specifically, ensure that the method accurately checks whether a namespace has been provided and handles the error reporting appropriately without misidentifying or omitting necessary errors related to undeclared variables. Adjust the logic to correctly manage and report namespaces that are required but not provided, ensuring that the test case does not fail due to incorrect or missing error handling.
