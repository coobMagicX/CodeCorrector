Intent: The test case `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` is intended to check if the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class can correctly interpret and format strings containing escaped quotes, specifically to ensure that double single quotes ('') are treated as a literal single quote (') in the formatted output.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure that the handling of escaped quotes is correct. This involves:
1. Ensuring that the loop iterating through the pattern string correctly identifies and processes escaped quotes without altering other parts of the string unnecessarily.
2. Correctly updating the `ParsePosition` index after processing an escaped quote to avoid parsing errors or infinite loops.
3. Ensuring that the append operation in cases of escaped quotes correctly appends the single quote to the `appendTo` StringBuffer and then resumes parsing after the escaped quote.
4. Adding comprehensive boundary checks and ensuring that the final string is correctly constructed when escaped quotes are present.
5. Reviewing and possibly refactoring the handling of `null` values for the `appendTo` parameter to ensure consistent behavior throughout the method. 

This repair will help ensure that patterns with escaped quotes are parsed and formatted correctly, thus allowing the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class to pass the test case and handle similar practical use cases.
