Intent: The test case `testIssue620` appears to be checking the formatting correctness in handling slashes and spaces within an alert function call in JavaScript, particularly related to regular expression literals and division operators. The intent is to ensure the code maintains proper spacing to avoid syntax or interpretation errors, especially in minified JavaScript.

Repair strategy: Update the `add` function to better handle scenarios involving slashes (`/`). The current implementation may not correctly differentiate between different contexts where a slash is used (e.g., as a division operator vs. as part of a regular expression). Enhance the logic to contextually determine when a space should be added between characters. This may involve parsing the string more thoroughly to understand its structure or maintaining a state that reflects whether the last character was part of a regular expression or an operator. This could involve implementing a stack or a state machine to track the context of slashes and other operators.
