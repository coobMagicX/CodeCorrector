Intent: The test case aims to verify whether the method `shouldTraverse` correctly handles assignments to properties of the prototype using computed property names (e.g., `a.prototype['x' + 'y']`). The purpose is to ensure that the method can handle and appropriately decide traversal for different JavaScript syntax forms including complex property assignments.

Repair strategy: Modify the `shouldTraverse` method to ensure it properly checks and handles computed properties that involve prototype modifications. The current implementation only explicitly checks for static string "prototype" in direct property access forms (`Token.GETPROP`). The repair should involve enhancing the condition checks to also consider computed properties (likely involving `Token.GETELEM`) that modify the prototype.
