Intent: The failing test case `testLocalizedSideEffects9` is intended to verify that returning a locally modified object within a function does not constitute a global side effect. This is important for understanding the scope of variables and ensuring that changes remain local where expected.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to properly handle cases where a new object is created and modified locally before being returned by a function. Specifically, the handling of the `Token.NEW` case within the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method appears too simplistic. The method should be enhanced to check whether the returned object is modified only within the local scope and not aliased or otherwise exposed globally. This might involve tracking the modifications to the object post-construction and verifying that these modifications do not leak to a global scope or alter global state. This can be done by enhancing the logic related to object creation and its subsequent usage within the `Token.NEW` handling to assess the locality of changes more robustly.
