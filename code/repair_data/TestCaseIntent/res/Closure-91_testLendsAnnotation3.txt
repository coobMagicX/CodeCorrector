Intent: The test case `testLendsAnnotation3` intends to evaluate the `shouldTraverse` method by checking if the function `foo` defined within an object that is annotated with `@lends {F.prototype}` should be traversed. The use of `dojo.declare` suggests a scenario involving inheritance or mixin behavior, where methods are added to the prototype of an existing constructor function.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a condition to handle the case where the function is part of an object that is being lent to a prototype, particularly through an annotation like `@lends`. This might involve checking the presence and context of `@lends` annotations and ensuring that functions within such an object are correctly traversed, especially when these functions are not direct prototype assignments but are part of an object declaration linked to a prototype via a library function like `dojo.declare`. The code needs to accurately detect and allow traversal for cases where the prototype properties are being extended through such a pattern.
