Intent: The test `testVersionFlag2` is intended to verify that when the `--version` flag is passed, the program outputs the version information of the compiler at the start of the error stream.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a specific check for a version flag (like `--version`) in the `parseArguments` method. When this flag is encountered, the method should handle it appropriately by triggering actions (such as displaying version information) instead of treating it as a true/false parameter. This could involve adding a new condition in the `parseArguments` method to check for the version flag and then execute a separate branch of code designed to handle version information output.
