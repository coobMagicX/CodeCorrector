Intent: The purpose of the test case `testDrawRangeGridlines` is to verify that the system can handle the scenario where the plot's renderer is explicitly set to `null`. This test case is designed to ensure that even in the absence of a specified renderer, the chart is still able to render without throwing exceptions, particularly when drawing gridlines which rely on dataset bounds calculations.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to robustly handle cases where the renderer might be null. This involves checking for null values of the renderer within the `getDataRange` method before attempting to access methods on the renderer object. The code should include null checks before every use of the renderer and provide appropriate fallback or default behavior when the renderer is null. This will prevent NullPointerExceptions and ensure that the system remains stable and functional even if no renderer is specified.
