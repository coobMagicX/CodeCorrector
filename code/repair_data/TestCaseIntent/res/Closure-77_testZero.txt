Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify that the `strEscape` function correctly escapes zero characters (null characters) in JavaScript string literals, ensuring that they are represented properly in the output string.

Repair strategy: The provided source code lacks explicit handling for null characters (`\0`). To address this, update the `strEscape` function to include a case for the null character (`'\0'`). This case should append a properly escaped null character sequence (`"\\0"`) to the `StringBuilder` object. Ensure that this handling is consistent with JavaScript string literal requirements and correctly encodes the null character regardless of the surrounding context.
