Intent: The test case `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties6()` is designed to validate that the source code correctly handles visibility rules, specifically ensuring that overriding a private property with a non-private property in a different file is not allowed and triggers an appropriate error.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the conditional checks for property visibility, particularly ensuring that private properties are not overridden by non-private properties from another file. The code should handle cases where an overriding property in a subclass attempts to change the visibility of a private property inherited from a superclass. Ensure the error handling logic correctly identifies and reports such visibility mismatches.
