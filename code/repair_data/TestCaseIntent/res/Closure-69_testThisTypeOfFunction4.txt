Intent: The intent of the test case `testThisTypeOfFunction4` is to verify that appropriate handling of the "this" type occurs when calling methods on custom objects that are constructed using a constructor function. The test confirms that methods such as `moveTo` and `lineTo` on instances of `F` correctly consider the "this" type, ensuring the methods are invoked correctly and the context (`this` value) is correctly maintained, especially in conditional or dynamic calling scenarios.

Repair strategy: The source code should be enhanced to include checks for the proper handling of the "this" type when methods are called dynamically (such as through conditional expressions). The existing implementation in the `visitCall` method lacks explicit validation for functions called through dynamic property access (like `GETPROP` or `GETELEM`), particularly when the calling pattern depends on runtime conditions. The repair should involve:
1. Extending the type-checking logic to verify that methods invoked on instances correctly maintain the "this" type, especially when methods are accessed through expressions that evaluate to function references (like `i == 0 ? path.moveTo : path.lineTo`).
2. Implementing or enhancing the logic to handle dynamic method calls and ensure that the correct "this" context is passed and validated against the expected type, possibly by refining how method calls are analyzed and processed within the `visitCall` method or related methods handling property access and function invocation.
