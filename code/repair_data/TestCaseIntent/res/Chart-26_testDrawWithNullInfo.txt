Intent: The test case `testDrawWithNullInfo` aims to verify that the chart can be created and rendered into a `BufferedImage` without throwing any exceptions, even when no `PlotRenderingInfo` (or `plotState`) is provided (i.e., it is passed as `null`).

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle cases where `plotState` is `null` gracefully. This involves ensuring that any operations performed with `plotState` and its subsequent objects (like `owner` and `entities`) inside the `drawLabel` method include null checks before accessing properties or methods of these objects. This will prevent `NullPointerException` when `plotState` or related objects are not available.
