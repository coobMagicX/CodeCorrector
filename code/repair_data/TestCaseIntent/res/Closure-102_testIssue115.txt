Intent: The test case `testIssue115` aims to ensure that during the SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS compilation level, the transformation of a JavaScript function that utilizes the `arguments` object does not incorrectly modify its declaration or scope, specifically ensuring that `var arguments` remains local to the function and does not become global or is improperly altered.

Repair strategy: The source code likely contains a bug in the handling of variable scope during transformations, particularly when the `MAKE_LOCAL_NAMES_UNIQUE` feature is active or when optimizations are applied. To repair the source code:
1. Review and modify the `MakeDeclaredNamesUnique` class to ensure it correctly handles special JavaScript variables like `arguments`, which have unique scoping rules.
2. Ensure that during transformations, local variable declarations are not altered to change their scope unintentionally.
3. Add specific checks or conditions in the renaming or optimization process to handle the preservation of the local scope of the `arguments` object within functions.
