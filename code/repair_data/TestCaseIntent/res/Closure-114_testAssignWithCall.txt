Intent:
The test case `testAssignWithCall` intends to verify the behavior of the `recordAssignment` method when handling assignments where the right-hand side (RHS) is a function that references a variable. The test checks if the function correctly maintains the scope and dependencies of variables involved in such assignments, particularly when the assignment is used as part of a function call.

Repair strategy:
The main issue appears to be related to how dependency scopes are recorded for assignments nested within function calls. The current implementation might not properly handle the scoping or dependencies when the assignment expression is part of a larger expression (like a function call). The repair should focus on enhancing the handling of such nested assignments, ensuring that the dependency scope is correctly determined and recorded, especially when assignments are not merely statements but part of expressions. This might involve modifying or extending the conditions under which `recordDepScope` is invoked, potentially adding checks or logic to correctly handle cases where assignments are embedded within other expressions or calls.
