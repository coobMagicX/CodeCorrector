Intent: The test case `testGetTypedPercent5()` is designed to check whether the code correctly calculates the typing percentage of an enumeration declaration where each key is associated with a number type. The expected result is that 100% of the code is typed, as the enumeration is fully annotated.

Repair strategy: Review the handling of enumeration (`Token.OBJECTLIT`) nodes within the `visit()` method to ensure that they are properly typed and accounted for. This may involve verifying the integration with type inference and ensuring that each key within the enumeration is recognized and typed as specified. If the enumeration is not being typed correctly, ensure that the node type and associated JSType are being set and recognized in the type counting logic (`doPercentTypedAccounting`). Ensure that the logic for type inference and type setting for object literals and their keys is correctly implemented and integrates seamlessly with the type accounting system.
