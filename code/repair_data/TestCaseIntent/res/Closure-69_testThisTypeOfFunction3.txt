Intent: The test case `testThisTypeOfFunction3` is intended to ensure that functions defined with a specific 'this' type are called with the correct 'this' context. The function `bar` is defined on the prototype of `F` and should be called with `F` as the 'this' context.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a check that functions which explicitly mention a 'this' type are called in a context that matches the specified 'this' type. This could involve inspecting the call context (`this` value) at runtime against the expected 'this' type from the function's JSDoc information, and throw/report an error if there is a mismatch.
