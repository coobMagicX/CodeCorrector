Intent: The intent of the test case `testNoStringJoin` is to verify that the `tryFoldArrayJoin` method does not incorrectly optimize or fold JavaScript array join operations when the join arguments are not simple immutable values (e.g., strings or numbers) or when there are additional arguments beyond the join delimiter.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to handle cases where the `.join` method is called with parameters that should not lead to folding. This includes:
1. Ensuring that the method checks for additional arguments beyond the first parameter in the join method call, which should prevent folding when not appropriate.
2. Verifying the type and count of parameters passed to `.join` before deciding to fold, ensuring that only simple, single-parameter calls are optimized.
3. Adding conditions to check if the `right` node, representing the first argument to `.join`, has siblings (indicating more parameters) and handling these cases appropriately to avoid incorrect string folding and joining operations.
