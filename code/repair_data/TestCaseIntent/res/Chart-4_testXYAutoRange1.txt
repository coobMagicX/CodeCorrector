Intent: The test case `testXYAutoRange1` is intended to verify that the auto-ranging feature of the domain axis correctly calculates and adjusts the axis bounds to include a small margin around the minimum and maximum data points in the dataset. Specifically, it checks if the domain axis automatically adjusts its range from 0.9 to 3.1 when data points in the dataset range from 1.0 to 3.0.

Repair strategy: Assess the implementation of the `Range.combine()` method and the logic used to calculate the auto-range in the `getDataRange()` method. Ensure that the method accounts for a margin around the data bounds when no additional settings (like `axis.setAutoRangeIncludesZero(false)`) are influencing the range. Modify the `getDataRange()` method to check if the axis is configured to automatically include zero, and if not, adjust the data range accordingly to add a margin around the dataset bounds. Alternatively, if the axis auto-ranging logic is handled elsewhere (e.g., within the axis class), ensure that this functionality is correctly implemented and invoked.
