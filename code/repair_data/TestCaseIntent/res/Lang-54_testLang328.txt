Intent: The test case `testLang328` is intended to verify that the method `toLocale` correctly handles and parses locale strings that include a language code, an empty country code, and a variant. The input "fr__POSIX" should be parsed into a `Locale` object with the language "fr", an empty country code, and the variant "POSIX".

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to correctly handle cases where the country code is explicitly empty (represented by "__"). The current logic fails because it incorrectly assumes that a non-empty country code follows immediately after the first underscore, which results in an error when trying to parse the variant. Adjust the logic in the method `toLocale` to allow for an empty country code (double underscore) and then correctly parse and extract the variant part of the locale string.
