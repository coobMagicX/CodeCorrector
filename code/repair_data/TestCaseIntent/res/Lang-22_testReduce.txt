Intent: The `testReduce` method intends to validate the functionality of the `reduce` method of the `Fraction` class, ensuring that fractions are correctly reduced to their simplest forms, handling both positive and negative numbers, and managing edge cases like zero numerators and the minimum integer values.

Repair strategy: The source code should incorporate safe handling for cases where negative values are converted or manipulated to avoid overflow, especially with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which cannot be negated in Java. The `greatestCommonDivisor` method should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where one of the inputs is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. A check should be implemented to prevent the overflow error when negating `Integer.MIN_VALUE` or dividing it by two, and to ensure that the result is correct even when dealing with the extremities of integer values in Java. Consider adding specific conditions or using a different mathematical approach for edge cases involving `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
