Intent:
The intent of the test case `testInterface1` is to verify that the function `shouldTraverse` correctly decides whether to traverse nodes within a JavaScript function declared as an interface. In this specific test, the function `A` is annotated as an `@interface` and contains a property `m2` of type `string`. The test aims to ensure that the traversal behavior is correct for interfaces, which might have different rules compared to regular functions or constructors.

Repair strategy:
The repair should focus on modifying the `shouldTraverse` method to correctly handle functions annotated with `@interface`. Currently, the method checks for constructors, `@this` annotations, and `@override` annotations but does not consider the `@interface` annotation. The repair should include:
1. Checking if the function has an `@interface` annotation and defining the correct traversal behavior for such cases.
2. Ensuring that properties within an interface (like `m2` in function `A`) are correctly handled during the traversal, potentially requiring additional logic to support interface-specific rules.
3. Adjusting the conditions under which traversal is stopped or allowed, specifically accommodating scenarios unique to interfaces, which might not fit the existing conditions designed for functions, constructors, or methods with other annotations.
