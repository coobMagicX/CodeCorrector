Intent: The test case `testQualifiedNameInference5` is intended to verify that the type inference and checking mechanisms correctly identify and flag type mismatches between actual and formal parameters in function calls, particularly in more complex scenarios involving namespaces and closures.

Repair strategy: The source code needs improvements in handling type checks and inferences, especially for function properties defined on objects within anonymous functions. The repair should:
1. Ensure that type information of functions attached to objects (like `ns.foo` in the test case) is properly tracked and validated across different scopes and closures.
2. Improve the linkage between declared types in function annotations (`/** @param {number} x */`) and their usage in different contexts to ensure that type mismatches are effectively caught. This might involve better propagation of type information across different parts or layers of the code, possibly by enhancing how scopes handle type definitions and how type checks are performed in nested or anonymous functions.
