Intent: The purpose of the test case `fold("x = 1 / 0", "x = 1 / 0");` is to verify how the code handles division by zero within an arithmetic operation, ensuring that it does not compute an illegal operation and instead preserves the divide by zero expression unsimplified.

Repair strategy: Modify the handling of division and modulo operations in the `performArithmeticOp` method to ensure that when a division by zero occurs, the method does not attempt to compute the result but instead returns a representation of the division by zero expression, maintaining the integrity of the original arithmetic expression in such cases. This can be achieved by checking if the denominator is zero and returning a special node or error node that represents the divide by zero error, rather than returning null or throwing an error.
