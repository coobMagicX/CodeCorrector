Intent: The test case `testDeepNestedFinally` is designed to verify the correct control flow graph (CFG) construction for nested try-finally blocks, handling exceptions, and ensuring proper control flow transitions between various blocks such as `try`, `finally`, `throw`, `if`, and variable declaration within these blocks.

Repair strategy: Inspect and possibly revise the handling of `try` and `finally` blocks in the `computeFollowNode` function to ensure that control flow edges are correctly established in deeply nested structures. Specifically, enhance the management of transitions out of `finally` blocks to guarantee that control is accurately transferred to the appropriate successor node according to the CFG logic, especially when exceptions are thrown. Ensure that the CFG correctly captures the flow from the `if` statement within a `finally` block to subsequent blocks under exceptional conditions (`Branch.ON_EX`).
