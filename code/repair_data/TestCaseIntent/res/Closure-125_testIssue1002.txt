Intent: The test case `testIssue1002` seems to be designed to verify the type-checking behavior of a JavaScript type system when handling interfaces and constructors. Specifically, it tests the system's ability to correctly handle and report types when constructors implementing the same interface are compared for equality and subsequently used to instantiate an object.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle the type comparisons and ensure that implementations of interfaces are recognized as valid constructor types. This includes:
1. Enhancing the `getJSType` method to accurately return function types for constructors that implement interfaces.
2. Ensuring that the type checking system correctly identifies and allows constructors of interfaces to be used in `new` expressions without erroneously reporting them as not being constructors.
3. Adding or refining logic in `visitNew` to correctly handle and differentiate interface implementations, possibly by improving how `isConstructor`, `isEmptyType`, and `isUnknownType` conditions are evaluated for such types.
