Intent: The test case `testEscapeJavaScript` is intended to check the functionality of escaping JavaScript strings correctly to ensure they are safe to use in a JavaScript context. This includes escaping single quotes, double quotes, and handling special characters properly.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the escaping logic in the `escapeJavaStyleString` method to handle JavaScript-specific escaping requirements, such as escaping forward slashes (`/`) to prevent closing of script tags prematurely. Also, the method should ensure that all characters that require escaping in JavaScript contexts (like single quotes within single quotes) are handled correctly and consistently. Implement a more comprehensive handling mechanism for JavaScript special characters and ensure consistency with JavaScript escaping rules.
