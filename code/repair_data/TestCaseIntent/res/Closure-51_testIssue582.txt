Intent: The test case `testIssue582` intends to verify that the method `addNumber` correctly handles the printing of negative zero (`-0.0`) in a formatted string without unnecessary spaces or symbols, ensuring the output matches "var x=-0.0".

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly identify and handle the case of negative zero (`-0.0`). This may involve adding a specific check for `-0.0` to ensure it is formatted correctly, considering that the `if ((long) x == x)` condition does not correctly handle floating-point numbers like `-0.0`. Adjustments might also be needed in how the string concatenation and formatting are done, to avoid additional spaces or incorrect formatting when dealing with negative zero and similar floating-point edge cases. Detecting and explicitly managing the formatting of `-0.0` could involve adding a condition at the start to check if `x` is `-0.0` and handle its string conversion separately.
