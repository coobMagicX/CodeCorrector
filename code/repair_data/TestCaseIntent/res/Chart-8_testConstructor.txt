Intent: The test case `testConstructor` aims to verify that the `Week` class correctly calculates the week number for a given date, taking into account different time zones and locale settings. It checks the functionality under varying locales (Danish in Denmark and US settings) to ensure that the week number calculation is consistent with localized week definitions (starting from Monday in Denmark and from Sunday in the US).

Repair strategy: The failure at `assertEquals(35, w.getWeek());` indicates an issue with handling the first day of the week based on locale-specific settings. The source code likely does not correctly adjust the week number calculation when the first day of the week changes due to locale differences. To repair this, the code should incorporate locale-aware calculations for determining the start of the week and adjust how week numbers are calculated based on these settings. This might involve modifying the constructor of the `Week` class to correctly interpret the `TimeZone` and `Locale` passed to it, ensuring that the first day of the week is considered when computing the week number. A thorough review and potential redesign of how `Week` calculates week numbers with respect to different starting days of the week will be crucial.
