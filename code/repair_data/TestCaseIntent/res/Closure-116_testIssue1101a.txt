Intent:
The intent of the test case `testIssue1101a` is to verify that the function `foo` cannot be inlined directly due to side effects within the function, such as modifying a mutable state (`modifyX()`), which should prevent the inlining process. The test expects that the method `canInlineReferenceDirectly` returns `CanInlineResult.NO` when attempting to inline a function that contains operations affecting global state or mutable variables.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy involves ensuring the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method accurately detects and handles cases where function calls within the target function (`foo` in this case) may have side effects or modify mutable state. Specifically, the method needs to:
1. Correctly identify and evaluate the impact of function calls like `modifyX()` within the function body that may affect mutable state.
2. Ensure that these side effects lead to returning `CanInlineResult.NO`, indicating that inlining should not proceed. 

To implement this, additional checks might be needed within the loop that processes each argument of the call node to detect side effects accurately, possibly refining the conditions under which `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` and `NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects` are assessed or the way they are implemented.
