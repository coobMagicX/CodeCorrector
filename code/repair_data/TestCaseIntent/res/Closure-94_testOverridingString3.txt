Intent: The purpose of the `testOverridingString3` test case is to verify that the system can handle the overriding of a string define with a concatenation operation of two string literals (i.e., `'x' + 'y'` should be overridden by `"foo"`).

Repair strategy: Examine and modify the `isValidDefineValue` method to correctly handle binary operations involving string literals. This should include handling the `Token.ADD` case for concatenation of strings, ensuring both operands of the concatenation are valid (in this case, simple string literals). The method should recursively check the validity of both operands in binary operations like addition to accommodate string concatenations as valid inputs.
