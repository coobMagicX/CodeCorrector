Intent:
The intent of the test case `testStructuralConstructor3` is to verify that the parsing of a JSDoc type expression specifying a constructor function correctly results in an object type. The JSDoc `@type {function (new:*)}` indicates a type expression where the function can be used as a constructor to create instances of any type (indicated by `*`).

Repair strategy:
The current implementation of the `parseContextTypeExpression` method likely does not properly handle parsing complex function types, particularly those involving constructor signatures like `function (new:*)`. The repair should involve enhancing the `parseTypeName` method or modifying `parseContextTypeExpression` to accurately parse and represent function types with constructor semantics. This might include implementing a new parser logic that correctly interprets and constructs an appropriate structure for constructor function types, ensuring that the resulting type is recognized as an object type, as constructors in JavaScript are functions that create instances.
