Intent: The test case `testIssue586` intends to verify proper handling of function redefinition and function call argument count validation in a class prototype. It checks that a function initially defined with parameters can subsequently be redefined and that calling the original function without the required parameters raises an error.

Repair strategy: The source code must be adjusted to better handle scenarios where functions are redefined on the prototype after being initially defined with specific arguments. Ensure that the function property handling correctly updates function definitions and validates argument counts during function calls. Also, enhance the static type analysis in the JavaScript codebase to capture and enforce the function parameter requirements consistently, even after reassignments.
