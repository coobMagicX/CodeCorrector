Intent: The test case `testNoInlineIfParametersModified9` is intended to check that the function `f(a)` should not be inlined when the function modifies one of its parameters (`a[2]=2`). The parameter `a` is an array or object being modified within the function, and thus, inlining this function could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the program.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to ensure that functions which modify their parameters (especially through array or object property assignments) are flagged as not suitable for inlining. This can be achieved by enhancing the checks within the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method to detect modifications to function parameters, particularly focusing on the assignments inside the function body that alter the state of input parameters. Add a specific check to see if any assignments are made to the properties of a parameter and return `CanInlineResult.NO` if such modifications are detected.
