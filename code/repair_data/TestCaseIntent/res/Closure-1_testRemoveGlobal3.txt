Intent: The test case `testRemoveGlobal3` intends to verify that the function `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` does not remove unreferenced function arguments when the `removeGlobal` flag is set to false. It checks that a nested function's unused argument remains intact despite not being used within the function body.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to respect the `removeGlobal` setting when deciding whether to remove unused function arguments. This could involve adding a check for this flag in the conditional logic that determines whether to strip unreferenced arguments. If `removeGlobal` is false, the function should skip the removal process for function arguments, even if they are unreferenced. This would ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expectations set in the test case.
