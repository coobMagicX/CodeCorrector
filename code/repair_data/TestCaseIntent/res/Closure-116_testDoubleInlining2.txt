Intent:
The intent of the test case `testDoubleInlining2` is to verify that the code correctly handles double inlining of function calls. It tests if the function `foo`, which inlines another function `bar`, properly handles the inlining when `bar` is passed as an argument to `foo`. The expected outcome is that the function `foo(bar(x))` should be simplified to `getWindow(x)` after the inlining transformation.

Repair strategy:
The repair should focus on ensuring that the inlining logic correctly handles nested function calls, particularly where the argument of one inlined function is another inlined function. The code needs to verify that it properly processes the transformation sequence from `foo(bar(x))` to `bar(x)` and ultimately to `getWindow(x)`. This may involve ensuring that the function call parameters are correctly passed through the nested inlines and that any side-effects or mutable states in the arguments are appropriately handled without losing the intended functionality. This might require adjustments in the logic that checks for mutable state effects or the reference count of parameters within nested function calls.
