Intent: The intent of the test case `testImplementsLoop` is to check whether the code correctly identifies and handles cyclic dependencies arising from a type implementing itself, which is invalid in JavaScript and many other programming languages. This scenario should trigger a parse error indicating a cycle in the inheritance chain.

Repair strategy: The source code should be enhanced to detect and correctly report errors when a type definition results in a cyclic dependency due to improper use of the `@implements` tag, especially in cases where a type attempts to implement itself. The error-checking mechanism should be refined or added if not present to handle such cases before proceeding with further type resolutions. This may involve improving the `resolveInternal` method or the methods it calls, such as `detectImplicitPrototypeCycle`, to better analyze and respond to cycles in type definitions and inheritance chains.
