Intent: The test case `testStructuralConstructor2` is intended to verify the correct parsing and interpretation of a type expression representing a structural type constructor in JavaScript. Specifically, it checks whether the parsed type is recognized as a constructor and simultaneously ensures it is not recognized as a nominal constructor. The type expression being tested is `function (new:?)`, which should indicate a constructor function that can be called with the `new` keyword, and the constructor's return type is unspecified (`?`).

Repair strategy: The method `parseContextTypeExpression` should be enhanced to correctly parse and handle type expressions related to constructors, especially those using the `new` keyword. This might involve implementing additional parsing logic inside `parseTypeName` or elsewhere in the parser to differentiate between nominal constructors and generic or structural constructors. The repair should ensure that the parser recognizes and adequately handles the `new` keyword within function type expressions, accurately setting properties that reflect the type's constructor status without misidentifying it as a nominal constructor.
