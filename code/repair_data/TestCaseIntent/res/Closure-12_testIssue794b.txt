Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue794b` appears to be to verify if the method `hasExceptionHandler` can accurately identify the presence of exception handling blocks (try-catch statements) within a given Node that represents segments of a code, such as a function or method body.

Repair strategy: Adjust the `hasExceptionHandler` method to actually analyze the Node (`cfgNode`) provided as an argument to determine if it contains any try-catch blocks. This may involve parsing the node's contents or examining its structure to check for the presence of exception handling constructs. The current implementation unconditionally returns `false`, which fails to detect the presence of try-catch blocks, hence it does not meet the requirements of the test case.
