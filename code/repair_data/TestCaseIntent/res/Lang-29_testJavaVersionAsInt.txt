Intent: The purpose of the test `testJavaVersionAsInt()` is to validate that the `toJavaVersionInt` method correctly converts a Java version given as a string into a numerical format that simplifies version comparison. The test checks various formats of version strings including simple versions, versions with minor and patch levels, and versions with prefixes or suffixes.

Repair strategy: Modify the `toJavaVersionInt` function to handle `null` inputs gracefully by returning `0` when a `null` string is passed. This likely involves adding a check at the beginning of the method to see if the input is `null` and returning `0` immediately if it is. This adjustment ensures that the method behaves consistently with the expectations outlined in the test cases for invalid or non-standard inputs.
