Intent: The test case `testParseLicense` is intended to parse a multiline license comment and validate that the extracted license text preserves the intended whitespace and line breaks as formatted in the comment, ensuring accurate documentation representation.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the logic in the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method related to handling whitespace and line breaks, especially under different `WhitespaceOption` settings. Ensure that newline characters and spaces are preserved according to the `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` setting when extracting multiline text blocks from comments. This might involve checking conditions around the use of `trim()` and `trimEnd()` methods or how spaces and newlines are appended to the `StringBuilder`. Additionally, verify that the logic correctly handles the transition from one line to another and accurately represents the starting and ending positions of characters in multiline comments.
