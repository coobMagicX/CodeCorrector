Intent: The test 'testDrawWithNullInfo2' is intended to verify whether the `drawLabel` method can execute without throwing any exceptions when rendering a chart with a `null` `PlotRenderingInfo` object. This is indicative of testing the method's robustness and error-handling capabilities when certain optional parameters are not provided.

Repair strategy: Inspect and revise the null handling in the `drawLabel` method specifically where the `PlotRenderingInfo plotState` and its subsequent usage scenarios are involved. Ensure that when `plotState` is null, the method should not attempt to access properties or methods on it or on objects derived from it like `plotState.getOwner()`. Implement null checks before accessing methods or properties of objects that are potentially null to prevent `NullPointerException`. This will make the function more robust and prevent failures in scenarios where `plotState` or related properties are not provided.
