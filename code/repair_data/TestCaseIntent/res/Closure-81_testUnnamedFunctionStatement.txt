Intent: The test case `testUnnamedFunctionStatement` aims to verify the parsing and handling of unnamed function statements in various contexts, including both standalone and within control structures. It expects the parser to correctly recognize and process unnamed functions as well as named functions.

Repair strategy: Investigate and adjust the handling of unnamed function statements in the `processFunctionNode` function. Specifically, ensure that when a function name is null, the function handles it correctly by setting the name to an empty identifier and adjusting line numbers and character positions accordingly. This repair might also involve verifying that the `transform` and `newNode` methods properly manage unnamed functions, ensuring that they do not lead to syntax or parsing errors.
