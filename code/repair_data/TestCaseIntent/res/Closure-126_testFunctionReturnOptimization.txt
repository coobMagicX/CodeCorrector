Intent: The intent of the test cases is to optimize and simplify JavaScript functions by removing unnecessary `return` statements without altering the logic or behavior of the code. The purpose is to refactor the code to be more concise and maintainable, ensuring that the functionality remains the same.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle the transformations of `return` statements within `try-catch-finally` blocks. Specifically, the code needs to better manage the removal of `return` statements in the `try` block while preserving the necessary `return` statements in the `finally` block. This will ensure that the `finally` block's control flow and exception handling behavior are not altered, adhering to ECMA 262 Sections 8.9 & 12.14 which dictate the semantics of `try-catch-finally` blocks. The repair should also ensure that all optimizations do not change the semantic meaning of the original function, particularly in complex structures involving multiple control statements.
