Intent: The test case `testAliasing7` aims to verify that the source code correctly handles the preservation of referenced values in functions when aliases are used in conjunction with prototype assignments. The intent is to make sure that when methods are aliased on a prototype, the original function references remain intact and correctly linked.

Repair strategy: The problem in the source code lies in the method `isPrototypePropertyAssign`, which should accurately identify and handle chained property assignments involving prototypes, particularly when strings are used as property keys (e.g., `e.prototype['alias1']`). The current logic seems to only handle direct property assignments and misses cases where the property key is a string literal within brackets, which is common in JavaScript for setting properties dynamically. The repair should involve enhancing the `isPrototypePropertyAssign` function to correctly detect and process assignments that use bracket notation for property keys on prototypes. This would involve checking if the `child` node in the conditional statement can handle both dot notation and bracket notation for properties effectively.
