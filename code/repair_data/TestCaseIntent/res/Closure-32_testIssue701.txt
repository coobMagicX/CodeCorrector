Intent: The test case `testIssue701` is intended to verify that ASCII art within license comments is preserved correctly when the input string is processed through the compiler. The test aims to ensure that indentation and spaces within the ASCII art remain intact, particularly when the `@preserve` annotation is used, which should maintain the original formatting.

Repair strategy: The source code should be examined to ensure that the `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` option is correctly handled throughout the text extraction and processing logic. Specifically, the code should not alter the spacing or formatting of the input text when `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` is active. This could involve checking the conditions and logic where line trimming and space addition are managed, particularly ensuring that the `trimEnd(line)` and `line.trim()` methods do not modify the text when preservation is required. Adjustments may also be necessary in how tokens and lines are appended to the output `StringBuilder` to respect the original formatting from the input.
