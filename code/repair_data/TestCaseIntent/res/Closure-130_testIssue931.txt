Intent: The test case `testIssue931` is intended to verify that the `inlineAliases` method handles the scoping and lifecycle of variables correctly, particularly in closures and asynchronous callbacks. It checks whether the `arguments` object in a function, which is used inside a `setTimeout` function, is preserved correctly after the inlining process.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the handling of the `arguments` object and other similar special objects within different scopes (especially in closures and asynchronous callbacks) is correct. The source code should include checks to prevent the inlining of variables like `arguments` when they are used in a way that could lead to incorrect behavior if moved or altered. This may involve checking the surrounding scopes or the usage context of such variables before deciding to inline them. Consider adding a condition to avoid inlining for variables that are used in closures or asynchronous callbacks, as these usages often rely on the original scoping for correctness.
