Intent: The test case `testBug4944818` is intended to verify the correct behavior of function inlining and URI manipulation within a JavaScript module. Specifically, it tests the functionality of inlining function calls that access and manipulate properties of complex objects (`domServices_` and `appContext_`) and ensuring the final URL is constructed correctly from these inlined functions.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to ensure that mutable state checks and side-effects evaluations are correctly handled during the inlining process. This includes:
1. Refining the logic in `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` and `NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects` to accurately determine the effects of function calls and object manipulations.
2. Ensuring that the function inlining logic respects the context and correctness of `this` references, especially when the function being inlined includes conditional assignments and accesses to nested properties.
3. Adjusting the inlining process to handle cases where functions are called with complex objects and involve conditionals, ensuring that such scenarios do not incorrectly trigger state alteration checks that prevent inlining.
