Intent: The intent of the test case `assertTrue(testValidDefineValue("1 + 8"))` is to verify that the expression containing a binary addition operator with two valid number operands is correctly evaluated as a valid define value by the `isValidDefineValue` function.

Repair strategy: The source code currently does not handle the addition operator (`Token.ADD`) in the `isValidDefineValue` function. To pass the failing test case, you should add handling for the `Token.ADD` case in the switch statement. This handling should check if both the left and right children of the addition operator node are valid define values, similarly to how other binary operators like `Token.BITAND` are checked. This will involve adding a case for `Token.ADD` in the switch statement and applying the same logic as other binary operators to ensure both operands are valid.
