Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1017` is to validate the `isSafeReplacement` method by ensuring that it accurately identifies scenarios where replacing parts of a property chain might lead to incorrect behavior, particularly when nested property accesses occur repeatedly in the same statement.

Repair strategy: Analyze the `isSafeReplacement` method to ensure it properly handles nested property accesses (`x.parentNode.parentNode`) and correctly determines whether a replacement in such scenarios is safe. The method should be enhanced to recursively check each node in the property chain, rather than stopping at the first child. This will ensure that replacements affecting deeper parts of the property chain do not introduce errors or modify the program's semantics in unintended ways.
