Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue538` is to verify whether the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function can correctly identify if a Node representing a JavaScript object with getter methods (in this case, properties of a prototype) qualifies as a reducable function expression. This is critical for optimizations in a JavaScript compiler or similar tool, where identifying such expressions can lead to more efficient code generation or refactoring.

Repair strategy: The `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method currently only checks if the node is a function expression using `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)`. This method needs to be enhanced or supplemented to also check for other forms of expressions that can be considered reducable, such as getter methods in an object's prototype. The repair should involve either extending the `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression` to include these cases or adding additional checks in the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method to handle specific cases like getters in object prototypes.
