Intent: The purpose of the test case `testProvideInIndependentModules4` is to ensure that the `replace()` function correctly handles the scenario where multiple `goog.provide()` calls across different modules declare nested namespaces and ensures these namespaces are created properly without duplications or incorrect structure.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `replace()` function correctly handles the creation and attachment of namespace nodes in the situation where similar or parent namespaces are declared across different modules. This might include ensuring that the namespace nodes are not recreated if they already exist, and that they are correctly nested. It should also ensure that any declarative nodes for namespaces are added in the correct order and at the correct hierarchical level in the code structure. The handling of the `addChildBefore` and `addChildAfter` methods should be reviewed to confirm that they are placing nodes in the correct positions relative to existing nodes, especially in complex namespace structures like the one in the test case.
