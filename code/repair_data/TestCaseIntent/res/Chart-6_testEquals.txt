Intent: The intent of the test `testEquals()` is to verify that the `equals()` method in the `ShapeList` class correctly identifies when two `ShapeList` objects are equal. This includes cases where the lists contain the same shapes in the same order, including `null` shapes.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of the `equals()` method in `ShapeList` relies on the superclass method `super.equals(obj)`, which likely does not handle the specific comparison logic needed for the contents of `ShapeList` objects (i.e., comparing each shape in the lists). The repair should involve overriding the `equals()` method to include a detailed comparison of each corresponding shape in the two `ShapeList` instances. This involves:
1. Checking if both lists have the same size.
2. Iterating through each shape in the lists and comparing them for equality, considering that shapes can be `null`.
3. Returning `false` immediately if any pair of corresponding shapes are not equal.
4. Ensuring the method handles null cases gracefully and conforms to the symmetry, transitivity, and reflexivity requirements of an `equals()` method.
