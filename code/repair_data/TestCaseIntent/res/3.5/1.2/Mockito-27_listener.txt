Analysis: The purpose of the `resetMock` method is to reset a mock object by setting a new callback filter on it. The specific failed line `verify(invocationListener).reportInvocation(any(MethodInvocationReport.class));` is trying to verify that the method `reportInvocation` of the `invocationListener` mock object was called with any `MethodInvocationReport` argument.

Reasons for failure: The specific failed line is failing because the `reportInvocation` method of the `invocationListener` mock object was not called during the test execution. This could be due to several reasons such as:
1. The `mockedList.clear();` call might not trigger the `reportInvocation` method call on the `invocationListener` mock object.
2. The `resetMock` method might not be correctly resetting the mock object or setting the callback filter as intended.
3. There could be an issue with the mocking configuration or setup that is preventing the `reportInvocation` method from being called.

To address this issue, you may need to review the test setup, the interactions with the mock objects, and the implementation of the `resetMock` method to ensure that the `reportInvocation` method is being correctly called and verified during the test.
