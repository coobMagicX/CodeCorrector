Analysis: The purpose of the failed test case is to check the behavior of marking calls in a specific scenario involving a new object creation and method invocation. The test aims to verify how different methods are marked based on the code structure and function calls.

Reason for failure at specific line `checkMarkedCalls(`: 
The failure at the `checkMarkedCalls(` line in the test case may indicate that the method `checkMarkedCalls` did not behave as expected when evaluating the calls in the provided code snippet. This could be due to issues with how the method is handling the marking of calls or discrepancies in the expected outcome of the test case compared to the actual results. Further investigation into the `checkMarkedCalls` method implementation and how it interacts with the test scenario is needed to identify the root cause of the failure.
