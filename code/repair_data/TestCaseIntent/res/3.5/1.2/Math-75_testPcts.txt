Analysis: The purpose of the `getPct` method is to return the cumulative percentage of a Comparable object. The specific failed line is testing the percentage calculation for the input value of 3.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the `getPct` method is attempting to cast an `Integer` object to a `Comparable` object, which is not valid due to the type casting mismatch. The method signature expects a Comparable object, but the input argument is directly an Integer object being cast to Object.

To fix this issue, the `getPct` method should be modified to handle Integer objects appropriately or the test case should be adjusted to pass a Comparable object instead of an Integer directly.
