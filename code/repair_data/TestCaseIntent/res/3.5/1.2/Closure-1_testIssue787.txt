Analysis: The purpose of the `testIssue787` test case is to check the transformation of a given JavaScript code snippet using certain compiler options. The `test` method is used to run the test with the specified options, input code, and expected result.

The specific failed line `test(options, code, result);` indicates that the test case failed to produce the expected result when running the transformation with the provided options and input code.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method in the source code is responsible for removing unreferenced function arguments, which could potentially affect the structure of the JavaScript code.
2. The transformation performed by the method might have altered the function arguments in a way that deviates from the expected result in the test case.
3. Any misalignment between the transformation logic in the method and the expected outcome of the test case could lead to failure.

To resolve the issue, you may need to review the logic within the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method to ensure that it handles function arguments correctly and aligns with the expectations of the test case.
