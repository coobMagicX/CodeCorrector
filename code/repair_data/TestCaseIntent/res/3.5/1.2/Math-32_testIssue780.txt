Analysis: The purpose of the `computeGeometricalProperties` method is to compute the geometrical properties of a polygon defined by its vertices. It calculates the size and barycenter of the polygon based on its vertices.

The specific line that failed:
```java
Assert.assertEquals( 8.0, polyhedronsSet.getSize(), 3.0e-6);
```

Reasons for the failure:
The failure indicates that the computed size of the polyhedron (polygon) is not equal to the expected value of 8.0 within the tolerance of 3.0e-6. This could be due to inaccuracies in the computation of the polygon's size within the `computeGeometricalProperties` method. The method may not be correctly handling the specific polygon provided in the test case, leading to an incorrect size calculation. Further debugging and validation of the size computation logic in the method may be necessary to address this failure.
