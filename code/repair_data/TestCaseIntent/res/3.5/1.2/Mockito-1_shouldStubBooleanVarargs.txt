Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and process them based on certain conditions. The failed line `assertEquals(true, mock.withBooleanVarargs(1));` indicates a failure in stubbing the method `withBooleanVarargs` to return `true` when called with the arguments `1`.

Reasons for the failure:
1. The method `withBooleanVarargs` is not correctly stubbed to return `true` when called with the argument `1`. This could be due to incorrect stubbing setup.
2. The method `captureArgumentsFrom` might not handle varargs arguments correctly for the method `withBooleanVarargs`, leading to unexpected behavior when the method is invoked with different arguments.
