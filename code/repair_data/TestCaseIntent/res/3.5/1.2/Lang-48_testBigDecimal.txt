Analysis: The purpose of the `EqualsBuilder` class is to provide a convenient way to compare objects for equality. The `append` method in the code snippet is used to handle comparisons between different types of objects, including arrays. The specific failed line is trying to compare two `BigDecimal` objects using the `EqualsBuilder`, but it fails to correctly handle the comparison due to the implementation limitations.

Reasons for failure: The `append` method in the `EqualsBuilder` class does not have specific handling for `BigDecimal` objects. Since `BigDecimal` is not a primitive type or an array, it falls into the last `else` block where it tries to compare arrays of `Object`, which is not the correct comparison logic for `BigDecimal` objects. This leads to incorrect equality comparison results for `BigDecimal` instances, causing the test case to fail. 

To fix this issue, the `EqualsBuilder` class should have a specific case to handle `BigDecimal` objects comparison logic appropriately.
