Analysis: The purpose of the `normalizedStandard` method is to create a normalized `Period` object based on the specified `PeriodType`. It calculates the total duration in milliseconds and then constructs a `Period` object with the normalized years and months.

The specific failed line `Period result = test.normalizedStandard(PeriodType.months());` failed because the expected result for months in the test case doesn't match the actual result returned by the method.

Reasons for failure:
1. In the `normalizedStandard` method, the calculation for years and months normalization might not be handling negative values correctly. This can lead to unexpected results when dealing with negative values for years or months.
2. The calculation logic for adjusting years and months based on the total number of months may have a flaw, leading to incorrect results when normalizing the period.

To fix the issue, you may need to review the logic for adjusting years and months in the `normalizedStandard` method to ensure that negative values and calculations are handled correctly for proper normalization.
