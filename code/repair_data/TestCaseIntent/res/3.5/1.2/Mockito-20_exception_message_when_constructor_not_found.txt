Analysis: The purpose of the `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` test case is to verify that a `MockitoException` is thrown with a specific message when a constructor is not found while creating a mock instance.

The specific line `fail();` failed in this test case because the test case expects an exception to be thrown, but the test case reaches the `fail();` line which indicates that no exception was thrown. This failure suggests that the expected exception was not thrown during the execution of the test case.

Reasons for the failure:
1. The `spy(HasConstructor.class);` method call did not result in a `MockitoException` being thrown as expected, which led to the test case not encountering an exception and reaching the `fail();` line.
2. The `spy(HasConstructor.class);` method may have found the constructor for `HasConstructor` successfully, preventing the expected exception from being thrown.

To fix the issue, ensure that the `HasConstructor` class does not have a suitable constructor for mocking, or revise the test logic to handle the actual behavior of the `spy` method when a constructor is not found.
