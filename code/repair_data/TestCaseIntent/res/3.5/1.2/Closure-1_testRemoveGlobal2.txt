Analysis: The purpose of the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method is to remove unreferenced function arguments from a given function scope. The intent is to optimize the function by removing unused arguments.

Reason for failure: The specific failed line `test("function y(x){var z;}", "function y(x){}");` failed because the method did not properly remove the unreferenced function argument `z` from the function `y`. This failure could be due to the logic within the method not correctly identifying `z` as an unreferenced argument and not removing it during the optimization process. Further investigation is needed to identify why the unreferenced argument `z` was not removed as expected.
