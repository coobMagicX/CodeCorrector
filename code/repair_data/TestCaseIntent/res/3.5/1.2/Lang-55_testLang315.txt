Analysis: The intent of the test case testLang315 is to check if the time elapsed during the suspended state is equal to the total time elapsed. The failed line assertTrue( suspendTime == totalTime ); is supposed to assert that the suspendTime and totalTime are equal after the stopwatch has been suspended and then stopped.

However, the specific line failed because the time spent during the suspend state is not considered in the calculation of totalTime. When the stopwatch is suspended, the stopTime is not updated to reflect the time spent in the suspend state. Therefore, suspendTime and totalTime will not be equal as expected.

To fix this issue, the implementation should update the stopTime when the stopwatch is suspended to accurately calculate the total time elapsed including the time spent in the suspend state.
