Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an `Invocation` object using matchers and store them in the corresponding `CapturesArguments` objects. The specific failed line `assertEquals(-1, mock.foo());` is part of a test case where the `mock.foo()` method is expected to return -1 after setting up a mock behavior using `when(mock.foo(anyVararg())).thenReturn(-1);`. However, the test fails at the assertion.

Reasons that caused the specific line to fail:
1. The `mock.foo()` method is not being called with the expected arguments or the captured arguments are not being properly handled within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. This could result in `mock.foo()` returning a different value than -1.
2. The setup of the mock behavior using `when(mock.foo(anyVararg())).thenReturn(-1);` might not be matching the actual method invocation during the test, leading to a different return value than expected.

To fix the issue, ensure that the captured arguments are correctly handled and passed to the `mock.foo()` method within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, and verify that the mock behavior setup matches the actual method invocation in the test case.
