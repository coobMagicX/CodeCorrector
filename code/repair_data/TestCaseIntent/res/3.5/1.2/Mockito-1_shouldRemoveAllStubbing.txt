Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an `Invocation` object and store them for further processing. The method handles different scenarios based on the type of matchers and arguments present in the invocation.

The specific failed line `when(mock.objectReturningMethod(200)).thenReturn(200);` failed because the method `objectReturningMethod` was not properly stubbed to return `200` when called with the argument `200`. This failure indicates that the capturing and processing of arguments within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method might not have been handled correctly for this specific case.

Possible reasons for the failure:
1. The method `objectReturningMethod` might not have been properly stubbed with the specific argument `200`.
2. The capturing logic within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method might not correctly handle the case where the method is called with the argument `200`.

To address the failure, ensure that the stubbing for the method `objectReturningMethod` with the argument `200` is correctly set up and that the capturing and processing logic within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is correctly implemented to handle this scenario.
