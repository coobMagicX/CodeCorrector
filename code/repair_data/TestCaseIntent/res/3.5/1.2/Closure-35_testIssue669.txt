Analysis: The purpose of the `inferPropertyTypesToMatchConstraint` method is to infer property types to match a given constraint from the provided types. The method iterates over properties of a constraint object and infers types for properties that are not declared in the object type to match the constraint.

The specific failed line `testTypes(` in the test case `testIssue669()` might have failed due to a missing method or setup in the test environment. This line is a part of the test case setup, and the failure could be due to issues such as missing test utility methods, incorrect test configuration, or setup problems in the test environment. Further investigation into the test setup and environment is needed to determine the exact reason for this specific line failure.
