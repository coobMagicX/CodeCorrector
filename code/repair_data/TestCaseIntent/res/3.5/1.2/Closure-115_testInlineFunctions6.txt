Analysis: The purpose of the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method is to determine if it's possible to inline a function call directly based on certain conditions related to the function nodes and call nodes. The method returns `CanInlineResult.YES` if the function call can be inlined, and `CanInlineResult.NO` otherwise.

The specific line that failed in the test case is part of a test method that aims to inline a more complex function call. The failure suggests that the inlining transformation did not produce the expected result.

Reason for failure: The failure could be due to the inlining logic not correctly handling the function `BAR_FN` in the test case. This could be caused by issues related to how the function parameters are handled, how the function body is transformed during inlining, or potential errors in identifying and replacing the function call with its inlined form. Further investigation and debugging of the inlining logic may be needed to address this failure and ensure correct inlining behavior.
