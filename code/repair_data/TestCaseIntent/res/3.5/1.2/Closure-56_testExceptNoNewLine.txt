Analysis: The purpose of the `getSourceLine` method is to retrieve a specific line of code from a given source file. The intent is to locate the line based on the line number provided as input. The method uses the `js` string which contains the entire code, then iterates through the lines to find the specified line.

The specific failed line `assertEquals("foo2:third line", provider.getSourceLine("foo2", 3));` failed because the method is not correctly returning the third line of the "foo2" source file.

Reasons for failure:
1. The loop in the method iterates until `n < lineNumber`, which means it stops before reaching the desired line. This causes the method to return the line after the specified line instead of the actual line.
2. The substring extraction logic is flawed. It finds the index of the next newline character but does not handle the case where the last line does not end with a newline character.

To fix the issue:
- Adjust the loop condition to iterate until `n <= lineNumber` to include the desired line.
- Modify the substring extraction logic to properly handle the case where the last line does not end with a newline character.
