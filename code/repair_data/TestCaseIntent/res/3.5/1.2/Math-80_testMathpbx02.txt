Analysis: The purpose of the `flipIfWarranted` method is to flip an array based on a specific condition. The intent is to swap elements of the array according to the specified logic and return true if the condition is met, otherwise return false.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(refEigenValues[i], eigenValues[i], 1.0e-3);` in the test case is comparing the computed eigenvalues with the reference eigenvalues with a tolerance of 1.0e-3. This comparison is failing, indicating a discrepancy between the expected eigenvalues and the computed eigenvalues.

Reasons for failure:
1. Precision issue: The computed eigenvalues might not match the reference eigenvalues exactly due to floating-point precision errors. This can occur when comparing floating-point numbers with strict equality.

2. Algorithmic error: There could be an issue in the eigen decomposition algorithm implementation (`EigenDecompositionImpl`) that leads to incorrect eigenvalues being computed.

3. Initialization problem: The input tridiagonal matrices `mainTridiagonal` and `secondaryTridiagonal` provided to the eigen decomposition might not be correctly initialized or formatted, leading to incorrect results.

To address the failure, you may need to investigate the eigen decomposition algorithm implementation, review the initialization of input matrices, and consider using a more appropriate tolerance level for floating-point comparisons.
