Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and possibly store them for later use. The method handles different scenarios based on the type of matchers and arguments passed in.

The specific failed line `stub(mock.objectReturningMethod(200)).toReturn(200);` failed because the method is unable to properly capture and process arguments for the invocation when dealing with varargs.

Reasons for failure:
1. The method does not handle varargs properly: The method checks if the invocation method is a varargs method, but it does not handle varargs arguments correctly when capturing and processing them. This leads to issues when trying to capture and process varargs arguments, resulting in incorrect behavior during stubbing.

2. Lack of implementation for capturing varargs: The code contains a comment `//TODO SF - this whole lot can be moved captureFrom implementation` indicating that the implementation for capturing varargs is incomplete or missing. This lack of implementation causes failures when trying to process varargs arguments.

To fix this issue, the method needs to be updated to properly handle varargs arguments by implementing the logic to capture and process varargs in a correct manner. Additionally, the missing implementation for capturing varargs as indicated in the comment should be completed to ensure the method functions as intended.
