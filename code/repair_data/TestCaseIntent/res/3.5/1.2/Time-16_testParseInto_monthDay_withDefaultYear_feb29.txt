Analysis: The purpose of the `parseInto` method is to parse a given text into a ReadWritableInstant object based on a DateTimeParser. In this specific failed test case `testParseInto_monthDay_withDefaultYear_feb29`, the intent is to parse the text "2 29" into a MutableDateTime object with the default year set to 2012 and verify that the result is a MutableDateTime representing February 29, 2004.

Reasons for failure:
1. The test fails at the line `assertEquals(new MutableDateTime(2004, 2, 29, 12, 20, 30, 0, LONDON), result);`
2. The failure could be due to an issue in the parsing logic or the handling of leap years, as February 29, 2004, is a leap year.
3. There might be a problem with how the parser handles the leap day and adjusts the date accordingly.

Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of the failure in parsing February 29, 2004, from the given text.
