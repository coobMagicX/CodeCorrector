Analysis: The purpose of the code is to perform optimization using Brent's method. The specific failed line is checking if the value of the function at the obtained solution point `sol` is less than or equal to the value of the function at the expected solution point `expected`.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed the test because the optimization algorithm did not converge to the expected solution point within the specified tolerance levels. This could be due to various reasons such as incorrect initial parameters, inappropriate convergence criteria, or insufficient iterations for convergence. The failure indicates that the optimization process did not find the expected solution within the defined constraints.
