Analysis: The purpose of the `Fraction` constructor is to create a `Fraction` object from a double value with certain constraints on the numerator and denominator. The specific failed line `checkIntegerOverflow(-1.0e10);` is trying to test for integer overflow when constructing a `Fraction` object with a large negative value.

Reasons for the failure: The specific line failed the test case because the value `-1.0e10` results in an overflow condition when converting the double value to a long integer. In the code, an overflow check is performed by comparing the calculated values `p2` and `q2` against the `overflow` limit (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`). In the case of a large negative value like `-1.0e10`, the calculation for `p2` and `q2` exceeds the `overflow` limit, triggering the exception `FractionConversionException`.
