Analysis: The purpose of the `processForInLoop` method is to transform a ForInLoop node in an abstract syntax tree (AST) into a new node with the appropriate structure. The intent is to handle the transformation of a for-in loop construct in the AST representation.

The specific failed line `parseError(` suggests that the test case is checking for proper handling of the `for each` construct, which is considered an unsupported language extension. The failure indicates that the `processForInLoop` method does not handle the `for each` construct properly, leading to the error message being triggered.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `processForInLoop` method does not have support for the `for each` syntax, causing it to fail when encountering such constructs in the input code.
2. The AST transformation logic in the `processForInLoop` method does not account for the specific syntax and semantics of the `for each` loop, resulting in the test case failure related to unsupported language extensions.

To address this issue, the `processForInLoop` method needs to be updated to handle the `for each` syntax appropriately or provide proper error handling for unsupported language extensions.
