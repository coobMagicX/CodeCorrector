Analysis: The purpose of the `getReadableJSTypeName` method is to determine and return a human-readable type name based on the given Node and dereference flag. The method handles different cases such as analyzing property access (`GETPROP`), dereferencing types, handling function types, and returning appropriate type names or qualified names.

The specific failed line `testTypes(` in the test case `testIssue1047` indicates that the test case is trying to test the behavior of the `getReadableJSTypeName` method when encountering an issue related to an undefined property access on an object of type `C2`.

Reason for failure: The failure occurs because the test is expecting the method to handle the case where a property (`prop`) is accessed on an object of type `C2`, but the property is never defined on `C2`. The method is expected to provide an appropriate error message or handle such cases gracefully, but it seems to not handle this specific scenario correctly based on the test case failure.
