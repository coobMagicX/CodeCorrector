Analysis: The purpose of the `tryFoldArrayJoin` method is to optimize array join operations in JavaScript code by folding adjacent string nodes together with a specified separator. The specific failed line `foldSame("x = [].join(',',2)")` indicates that the optimization did not work as expected when trying to fold an array join with a numeric value as one of the arguments.

Reasons for failure:
1. The code expects the second argument of the `join` function to be a string or null. In this case, the argument is `2`, which is not a valid input for the `join` function, causing the optimization to skip and return the original node `n` without any modifications.

2. The `tryFoldArrayJoin` method checks for immutability of the second argument of the `join` function before proceeding with the optimization. Since `2` is not an immutable value, the method returns the original node `n` without further processing.

3. The method expects the second argument of the `join` function to be a string value for proper folding. In this case, the argument `2` does not meet this requirement, leading to the failure of the optimization and the return of the original node `n`.

To address the failure for this specific case, you may need to handle non-string arguments in the `join` function differently or add additional checks to ensure that only valid arguments are processed for optimization.
