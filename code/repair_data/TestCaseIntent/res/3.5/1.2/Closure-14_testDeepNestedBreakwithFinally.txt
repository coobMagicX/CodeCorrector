Analysis: The purpose of the specific failed line `assertCrossEdge(cfg, Token.BLOCK, Token.BLOCK, Branch.ON_EX);` is to assert the cross edge between two block nodes in the control flow graph with the branch type `ON_EX` (on exception).

Reasons for the failure:
1. The specific failed line is trying to assert a cross edge between two block nodes with the branch type `ON_EX` (on exception). However, based on the implementation of the `computeFollowNode` method, the logic for handling exception edges in the control flow graph may not be correctly implemented.
2. The issue could be related to how exception handling, specifically within `finally` blocks, is being handled in the control flow analysis. There might be a missing or incorrect logic in determining the control flow paths in the presence of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.

To address this issue, you may need to review and potentially update the logic in the `computeFollowNode` method related to exception handling, specifically for `finally` blocks, to ensure that the control flow graph is correctly constructed to represent the flow of control in the presence of exceptions.
