Analysis: The purpose of the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method is to calculate the asymptotic p-value for the Mann-Whitney U test based on the given parameters. The method uses the normal approximation method to estimate the p-value.

Reasons for failure on the specific line `Assert.assertTrue(result > 0.1)`: The specific line failed the test case because the calculated p-value from the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method did not meet the expected condition of being greater than 0.1 for the provided big data set. This failure could be due to inaccuracies in the normal approximation method when dealing with very large sample sizes or specific characteristics of the data set that affect the calculation of Umin, EU, VarU, and z values leading to an incorrect p-value calculation.
