Analysis: The purpose of the `equals` method is to check if two `Complex` objects are equal based on their real and imaginary parts. The method compares the real and imaginary parts of two `Complex` objects using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits` method.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(new Complex(0,-1), new Complex(0,1).multiply(new Complex(-1,0)));` failed because the expected `Complex` object with real part 0 and imaginary part -1 did not match the actual result of multiplying two `Complex` objects: `new Complex(0,1)` and `new Complex(-1,0)`. This indicates that the multiplication logic in the `multiply` method of the `Complex` class might be incorrect, resulting in an incorrect product for these specific inputs. The equality check in the test case then fails because the expected and actual `Complex` objects do not match as intended.
