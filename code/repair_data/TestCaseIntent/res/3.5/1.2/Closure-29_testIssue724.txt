Analysis: The purpose of the `isInlinableObject` method is to determine if a given list of references represents object literal assignments that can be safely inlined. The method iterates over the references, checks various conditions, and returns a boolean indicating whether inlining is possible or not.

The specific failed line `test(options, code, result);` in the test case indicates a failure in running the test for issue 724. This failure could be due to multiple reasons, such as incorrect setup of the `CompilerOptions`, incorrect input code, or an issue with the expected result comparison.

To further diagnose the failure, you may need to investigate the `createCompilerOptions()` method, the `test()` method implementation, and potentially debug the test case to identify the root cause of the failure.
