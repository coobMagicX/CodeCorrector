Analysis: The purpose of the code is to determine if it is possible to inline a reference directly based on certain conditions. The specific failed line in the test case is used to test the inlining of function calls.

Reason for failure: The specific failed line in the test case fails because the test input is trying to inline a function call that includes another function call as an argument. The code logic to handle this scenario is not implemented in the canInlineReferenceDirectly method, leading to the test failure. The method is not designed to handle nested function calls within function arguments, causing it to return `CanInlineResult.NO` instead of the expected inline result.
