Analysis: The purpose of the `percentageValue` method is to return the percentage value of a Fraction instance by multiplying it by 100 and converting it to a double.

The specific failed line `Assert.assertEquals(percentage, frac.percentageValue(), Math.ulp(percentage));` failed because the implementation of the `percentageValue` method did not handle overflow scenarios correctly. This caused an incorrect calculation of the percentage value, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when comparing in the test case.

To resolve the issue, the implementation of the `percentageValue` method needs to be updated to handle overflow scenarios correctly, ensuring accurate calculation and conversion to percentage values.
