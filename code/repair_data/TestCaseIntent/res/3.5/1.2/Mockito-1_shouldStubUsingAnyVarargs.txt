Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and pass them to matchers implementing the `CapturesArguments` interface. The method handles regular arguments and varargs differently.

The specific failed line `assertEquals("foo", mock.run("a", "b"))` failed because the test case `shouldStubUsingAnyVarargs` is trying to stub the method `run` of a mock object with any varargs using `anyVararg()`, and then verify if calling `mock.run("a", "b")` returns "foo". However, the implementation of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method does not currently support capturing and processing varargs properly, leading to the test failure.

The method is throwing an `UnsupportedOperationException` when encountering varargs, which prevents the varargs from being properly captured and processed by the matchers.

To fix this issue, the implementation of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method needs to be updated to correctly handle varargs by capturing and processing them as expected when dealing with matchers that implement the `CapturesArguments` interface.
