Analysis: The purpose of the `bracket` method is to find a bracketed interval containing a root of a univariate real function within specified bounds. The method iteratively expands the bracket by adjusting the interval boundaries based on function evaluations until a root is bracketed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

The specific line `double result = normal.inverseCumulativeProbability(0.9772498680518209);` failed because the test case is trying to assert that the inverse cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution at the given value should be approximately 2.0 within a tolerance of 1.0e-12. However, this assertion fails, indicating that the calculated result is not close enough to the expected value.

Possible reasons for the failure could be:
1. Incorrect usage of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method: The method may not be returning the expected result due to incorrect implementation or input values.
2. Precision issues: The tolerance of 1.0e-12 may be too strict for the calculation, leading to a failure in the assertion even if the result is correct within a reasonable margin.
3. Incorrect expectation: The expected value of 2.0 may be incorrect for the given input value, leading to a mismatch in the assertion.

Further investigation into the implementation of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and the accuracy of the expected result may help in resolving the test failure.
