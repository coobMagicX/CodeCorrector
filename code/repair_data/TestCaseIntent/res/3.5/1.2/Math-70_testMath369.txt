Analysis: The intent of the `solve` method is to find the root of a UnivariateRealFunction within a given range. The specific line that failed in the test case is attempting to assert that the solver correctly finds the root of a SinFunction within the range [3.0, 3.2] with an initial guess of 3.1.

The reason this specific line failed is that the implementation of the `solve` method in the source code does not take into account the initial guess parameter provided in the method signature. Instead, it only calls another `solve` method with just the min and max values, ignoring the initial guess.

To fix this issue, the `solve` method should utilize the initial guess parameter provided in the method signature to start the root-finding process from that initial point.
