Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an `Invocation` object based on certain conditions and matchers. The method iterates through the matchers and captures arguments accordingly. The failed test case `should_capture_arguments_when_args_count_does_NOT_match` is trying to test the capturing of arguments when the argument count does not match. 

Reason for failure: The specific failed line `invocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(invocation);` failed because the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is not handling the case where the argument count does not match properly. This failure could be due to a mismatch in the number of arguments provided and expected by the matchers, leading to an unsupported operation exception being thrown in the method. The method needs to be modified to handle such cases where the argument count does not match the expectations of the matchers.
