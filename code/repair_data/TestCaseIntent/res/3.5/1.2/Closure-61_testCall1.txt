Analysis: The purpose of the `functionCallHasSideEffects` function is to determine if a function call has side effects based on various conditions and criteria. The function checks if the call node is a function call, if it's a built-in function with no side effects, if it's an object method without side effects, and other specific cases. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns true indicating that the function call has side effects.

Reasons for failure:
The specific failed line `test("Math.sin(0);", "");` in the test case `testCall1()` failed because the `functionCallHasSideEffects` function does not correctly handle the case of functions in the "Math" namespace. Specifically, the function is not checking for the "Math" namespace functions and their side effects properly, which leads to the incorrect evaluation that the call `Math.sin(0)` has side effects.

To address this failure, the function should have proper handling for functions in the "Math" namespace to correctly identify that they have no side effects.
