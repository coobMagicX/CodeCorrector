Analysis: The purpose of the `testParsePreserve` test case is to verify the extraction of a multiline textual block with the `@preserve` annotation. The specific failed line `assertEquals(" Foo\nBar\n\nBaz", node.getJSDocInfo().getLicense());` is checking if the extracted license matches the expected string.

Reasons for failure: The failure could be due to the whitespace handling in the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method. Since the test case includes newline characters and spaces in the expected license string, any discrepancies in whitespace handling within the method could cause the extracted license to not match the expected value. This discrepancy might be related to how whitespace is trimmed or preserved based on the `option` provided.
