Analysis: The purpose of the specific failed line `verify(table, times(2)).newRow(eq("x"), (String[]) anyVararg());` is to verify that the `newRow` method is called on the `table` object with specific arguments. The intent is to check if the method is invoked twice with the first argument being "x" and any varargs of type String.

Reasons for failure:
1. The failure may be due to the implementation not handling varargs correctly in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method.
2. The `captureArgumentsFrom` method may not correctly capture and process varargs when verifying the method invocation with varargs in the test case.

To fix this issue, you should review the implementation of `captureArgumentsFrom` method to ensure it correctly handles varargs and captures the arguments as expected when verifying method invocations with varargs in the test cases.
