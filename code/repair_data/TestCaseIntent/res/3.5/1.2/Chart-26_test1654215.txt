Analysis: The purpose of the `drawLabel` method is to draw axis labels on a chart in different orientations depending on the edge specified. The method calculates the position and rotation of the label text based on the axis edge. The intent is to correctly position and rotate the labels on the chart.

The specific failed line `assertTrue(success);` in the test case indicates that the test is expecting the chart drawing to be successful with no exceptions. However, if this assertion fails, it means that there was an exception thrown during the chart drawing process, causing the `success` flag to remain false.

Possible reasons for the test failure:
1. The chart drawing process encountered an exception that was not caught or handled properly.
2. Issues with the rendering of the chart or the creation of the image buffer.
3. Incorrect usage of the `LineAndShapeRenderer` or other chart components that led to an exception during drawing.
4. Problems with setting up the chart or plot configuration that caused the rendering to fail.

To address the failure, you may need to debug the chart drawing process, review the chart setup, and handle exceptions appropriately to ensure the successful rendering of the chart.
