Analysis: The purpose of the `add` method is to add a certain value to a specific field within a partial date. The method checks if the value to add is 0, and if not, it handles the addition based on whether the partial date is contiguous or not.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(expected, result);` failed because the test case `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is trying to add -1 month to a date (March 31st) resulting in February 29th. However, the implementation in the `add` method does not handle the adjustment for the end of the month correctly, leading to the failure of this test case.

The issue lies in how the method handles adding months to a date at the end of the month, which should adjust the date to the last day of the resulting month if it is not valid. This indicates a flaw in the logic for adjusting the date when adding months, especially when dealing with month boundaries.
