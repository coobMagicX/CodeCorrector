**Analysis:** The purpose of the `should_report_failure_if_constructor_throws_exception` test case is to verify that an exception is thrown when instantiating a `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` with a throwing constructor.

The specific failed line `new ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator(this, field("withThrowingConstructor"), resolver).instantiate();` failed because an exception was not thrown as expected.

The failure might be due to the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` not throwing an exception when instantiated with a throwing constructor. This could indicate a potential issue with the implementation of the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` class or the way it handles constructors that throw exceptions. Further investigation into the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` class and its instantiation logic is needed to identify and fix the issue.
