Analysis: The purpose of the `normalizedStandard` method is to normalize a `Period` object based on the specified `PeriodType`. The method calculates the total milliseconds of the period and then adjusts the years and months if needed to match the normalized form.

The specific line `Period result = test.normalizedStandard(type);` failed because the test is expecting the `result` object to be different from the `test` object, but the code is incorrectly setting the `result` to the same as `test` before any adjustments are made. This causes the test to fail as the `result` should be normalized based on the provided `PeriodType`.

To fix this failure, the `result` object should be assigned the result of the `normalizedStandard` method on the `test` object, rather than just assigning it as a reference to the `test` object itself.
