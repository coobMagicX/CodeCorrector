Analysis: The purpose of the `testIssue1002` test case is to verify the behavior of type checking when creating new instances of objects in JavaScript. The failed test case indicates that there might be an issue with the type checking logic in the `visitNew` method.

The specific failed line `testTypes(` indicates that the test failed at the testTypes function call, which suggests that the `visitNew` method did not handle the type checking correctly in this scenario.

Possible reasons for the failure:
1. In the given test case, it checks if `A === B` before creating a new instance of `B`. This condition might not be properly handled in the `visitNew` method, leading to incorrect behavior during type checking.
2. There could be a missing or incorrect implementation in the logic that deals with constructor types and interfaces, causing the type checking to fail in this specific scenario.
3. The `ensureTyped` method might not be applied correctly after checking the types, leading to an issue with type enforcement.

It's recommended to review the type checking logic in the `visitNew` method, especially around handling constructor types and interfaces, and ensure that the type restrictions are correctly applied based on the test case scenario.
