Analysis: The purpose of the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` function is to determine whether a function call can be inlined directly. In this specific failed test case, the function `f` is defined with a parameter `a` and it returns `a.x = 2`, and then it is called with an object `o`. The expected result is that `o.x` should be set to `2`.

The specific line failed in the test case is due to the function not being able to handle object property assignments as part of inlining. The function may not correctly handle the modification of object properties within the inlined function, leading to the test failure. To support inlining in this scenario, the function would need to consider and correctly handle object property assignments within the inlined function.

To address this issue, the function `canInlineReferenceDirectly` should be enhanced to properly handle object property modifications within the inlined function and adjust the logic to support such cases in order to pass the failed test case.
