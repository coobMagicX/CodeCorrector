Reason for Test Failure:
The test case testImplementsExtendsLoop intends to check for cycles in the inheritance chain, such as a class G implementing an interface F while F extends G, which logically creates a cycle. This situation should be detected and reported as a cycle error in the inheritance chain.

The specific line that failed the test is within the method testClosureTypesMultipleWarnings, which likely indicates that the resolution mechanism in resolveInternal failed to appropriately detect or handle the cycle introduced by the @implements and @extends annotations in the test case. The failure could stem from several reasons:

Cycle Detection Inadequacy: The detectImplicitPrototypeCycle method might not be effectively detecting cycles that involve both implements and extends relationships, possibly due to how these relationships are registered or checked in the type registry or properties.

Order of Resolution: The order in which types are resolved (resolveViaRegistry before resolveViaProperties) may affect how cycles are detected and handled. If resolveViaRegistry doesn't properly register the relationships leading to the cycle, subsequent calls (like resolveViaProperties or even the second call to detectImplicitPrototypeCycle) may not have the necessary information to detect the cycle.

Error Handling: The mechanism for handling detected cycles (handleTypeCycle) may not be adequately reporting or handling the cycle error back to the test framework, leading to the test detecting that the cycle was not reported as expected.

The failure of this specific test line suggests an underlying issue either in the cycle detection logic, the type resolution order, or error handling and reporting within the resolveInternal method. Adjusting these aspects could help in properly detecting and handling type cycles in JavaScript types, thereby passing the test.
