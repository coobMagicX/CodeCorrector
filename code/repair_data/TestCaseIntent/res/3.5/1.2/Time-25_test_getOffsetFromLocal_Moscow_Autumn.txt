Analysis: The purpose of the `getOffsetFromLocal` method is to calculate the offset from a local time instant based on the time zone information. The specific line that failed the test case is trying to calculate the offset for a specific local time instant in Moscow timezone during autumn transition.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed the test case because the method did not handle the DST transition correctly for the given local time instant. During the DST transition in autumn, the offset changes from UTC+4 to UTC+3 in Moscow timezone. The method should adjust the offset calculation accordingly to reflect this transition, but it seems to be returning an incorrect offset value. This discrepancy in handling the DST transition causes the test case to fail.
