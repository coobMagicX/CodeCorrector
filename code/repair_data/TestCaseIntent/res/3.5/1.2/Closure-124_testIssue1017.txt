Analysis: The purpose of the `isSafeReplacement` method is to check if a given node can be safely replaced by another node in a code snippet. The method should return true if the replacement is safe and false otherwise.

The specific failed line `testSame("x = x.parentNode.parentNode; x = x.parentNode.parentNode;");` failed because the method is not correctly handling the case where the same variable (`x`) is being assigned to multiple times consecutively. In this case, the method is not properly checking if the replacement node is safe for both assignments.

To fix this issue, you may need to enhance the logic inside the `isSafeReplacement` method to handle consecutive assignments to the same variable correctly. You should ensure that the method correctly checks if the replacement node is safe for all assignments in the code snippet.
