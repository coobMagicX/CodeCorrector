Analysis: The purpose of the `isValidDefineValue` method is to check if a given Node representing a define value is valid based on its type and content. In the specific failed line identified, the `test(` method is being called, likely to test the behavior of the method in a specific scenario related to overriding a string define value.

Reasons for failure: The failure in the specific line `test(` could be due to the test case setup not properly handling the scenario of overriding a string define value. The test case is attempting to override a define value with a new value, but the actual value after the test does not match the expected value. This mismatch could be due to issues in the implementation of how define values are handled or overridden within the code under test. Further investigation into the handling of define values and overrides in the test setup and the method being tested would be necessary to pinpoint the exact reason for the failure.
