Analysis: The purpose of the `isFoldableExpressBlock` method is to check if a given node is a foldable expression block. The specific failed line `foldSame("if (f) { f.onchange(); }");` indicates that the test for folding the expression `if (f) { f.onchange(); }` failed.

Reasons for failure:
The specific line failed because the `isFoldableExpressBlock` method does not handle the scenario where the expression inside the `if` statement includes a function call `f.onchange()`. The method is designed to check if the child node of a block is an expression, but it does not account for the specific expression `f.onchange()`, which is causing the test to fail. To address this issue, the method needs to be updated to handle function calls within expressions as well.
