Analysis: The purpose of the `testDrawWithNullInfo2` test is to verify that creating a BufferedImage from a JFreeChart with a null PlotRenderingInfo object should throw a NullPointerException. The specific failed line `assertTrue(success);` indicates that the test failed to catch the NullPointerException as expected.

Reason for failure: In the provided source code, the method `drawLabel` is responsible for drawing labels on a plot. The failure in the test case might be due to the fact that the `drawLabel` method does not directly throw a NullPointerException when `plotState` is null. Instead, it may execute the code block related to the `if (plotState != null && hotspot != null)` condition without throwing an exception, causing the test to fail as the NullPointerException is not caught as expected in the test case. To fix this, the method `drawLabel` should throw a NullPointerException explicitly when `plotState` is null to align with the test's expectation.
