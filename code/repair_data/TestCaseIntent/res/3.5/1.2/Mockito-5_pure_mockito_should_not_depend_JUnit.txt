Analysis: The purpose of the `checkDependency` method call in the `pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit` test case is to verify the dependencies of certain classes from the Mockito API when excluding JUnit dependencies. The test aims to ensure that Mockito can function independently of JUnit.

Reasons for failure: The specific failed line `checkDependency(classLoader_without_JUnit, pureMockitoAPIClass);` fails because the `verify` method in the source code does not handle the scenario where the `error` variable is set but the loop condition `while (timer.isCounting())` keeps the loop running indefinitely. This situation could lead to the test case hanging or not completing successfully, causing the failure. To resolve this, the `verify` method should have proper logic to exit the loop when necessary and handle any potential infinite loops.
