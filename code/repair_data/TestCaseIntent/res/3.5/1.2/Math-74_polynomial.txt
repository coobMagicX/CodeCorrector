Analysis: The purpose of the failed test case is to test the number of evaluations performed by the AdamsMoultonIntegrator for a polynomial problem with varying numbers of steps. The intent is to check if the number of evaluations falls within a certain range based on the number of steps taken.

The specific line "assertTrue(integ.getEvaluations() < 90);" is expecting the number of evaluations to be less than 90 when the number of steps is 4 or greater.

Reasons for failure: 
1. The number of evaluations may not be properly controlled or optimized based on the number of steps taken. 
2. There could be issues with the step size calculation or error estimation leading to more evaluations than expected. 
3. The implementation of the Adams-Moulton integration method may not be efficient enough to reduce the number of evaluations for higher numbers of steps. 

To address the failure, optimizations in the evaluation strategy, step size control, and error handling mechanisms may need to be improved to ensure the expected number of evaluations is met.
