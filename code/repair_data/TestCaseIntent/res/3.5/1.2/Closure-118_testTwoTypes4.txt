Analysis: The purpose of the `handleObjectLit` method is to process object literals in JavaScript code. It iterates over the properties of the object literal, retrieves their types, and performs certain operations based on the property types.

The specific failed line `testSets(false, js, output, "{a=[[Foo.prototype]]}")` in the test case `testTwoTypes4()` is failing because it is expected to return `false`, but it is not doing so.

Reason for failure:
1. The failure could be due to the logic in the `handleObjectLit` method where the check for mixing numbers and strings in property names is not handled correctly. This might lead to incorrect property handling and result in the test case failing.
2. Another reason could be related to how the `scheduleRenaming` method is implemented for the `Property` class. If the method is not correctly handling the child node and property information, it might not return the expected result, causing the test case to fail.

To resolve the issue, you should review the logic in the `handleObjectLit` method to ensure proper handling of property names and types, as well as the implementation of the `scheduleRenaming` method in the `Property` class to make sure it functions correctly with the provided child node and property details.
