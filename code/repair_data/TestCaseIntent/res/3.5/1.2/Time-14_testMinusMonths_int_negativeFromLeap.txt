Analysis: The purpose of the `add` method is to add a certain value to a specific field index in a `ReadablePartial` object. The method handles cases where the value to add is not zero and where the partial fields are contiguous. If the fields are contiguous, the method performs the addition operation and returns the updated values. Otherwise, it delegates the operation to the superclass method.

The specific failed line `MonthDay result = test.minusMonths(-1);` failed in the test case `testMinusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap()` because the expected behavior was to subtract a negative number of months from the given `MonthDay` object. However, the `minusMonths` method likely did not handle negative values correctly, leading to the test failure.

To address this issue, the `minusMonths` method implementation should properly handle negative values for subtracting months to ensure correct date calculations.
