Analysis: The purpose of the `ValueMarker` constructor is to create a marker with specified properties such as value, paint, stroke, outline paint, outline stroke, and alpha value. The intent is to set these properties accordingly.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(Color.blue, m.getOutlinePaint());` failed because the `ValueMarker` constructor is incorrectly assigning the `outlinePaint` to the `paint` parameter in the `super` constructor call. This means that the `outlinePaint` provided in the test case is actually being used as the paint for the marker, causing the `getOutlinePaint()` method to return the wrong color (`Color.red` instead of `Color.blue`).

To fix this issue, the `ValueMarker` constructor should correctly assign the `paint` and `outlinePaint` parameters to the appropriate fields in the constructor, ensuring that `getOutlinePaint()` returns the expected `Color.blue`.
