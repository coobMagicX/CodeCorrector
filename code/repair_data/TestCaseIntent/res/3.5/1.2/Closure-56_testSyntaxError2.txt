Analysis: The purpose of the specific line `assertTrue(e.getMessage().contains("if (true) {}}\n"));` is to check if the exception message contains a specific syntax error related to an if statement in the test case `testSyntaxError2()`. The intent is to verify that the exception message accurately reflects the syntax error encountered.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed because the expected syntax error message "if (true) {}}" with a newline character "\n" at the end was not found in the exception message. This could be due to the formatting or structure of the exception message not aligning with the expected format, causing the assertion to fail.
