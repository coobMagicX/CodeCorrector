Analysis: The purpose of the code snippet is to capture arguments from a method invocation and apply matchers to them. The specific failed line is related to setting up a mock behavior using the `when` method.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the mock object `localMock` was created with the setting `stubOnly()`, which means it is only meant to stub method calls and not verify them. The line `when(localMock.objectReturningMethod(200)).thenReturn(200);` is trying to set up a behavior for a method call on a stub-only mock, which is not allowed. This restriction leads to the failure of the test case.
