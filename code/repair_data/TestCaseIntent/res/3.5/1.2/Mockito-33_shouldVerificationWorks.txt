Analysis: The purpose of the `hasSameMethod` method is to compare two `Method` objects for equality. The specific line that failed the test is trying to verify if the `iterator()` method is called on an `Iterable` object.

The reason the specific line failed is due to the comparison logic in the `hasSameMethod` method. The method is directly comparing the `Method` objects using the `equals` method, which checks for reference equality. In the context of the failed test, the `Method` objects representing the `iterator()` method on the `Iterable` object are different instances, even though they represent the same method.

To fix this issue, you can update the `hasSameMethod` method to compare the methods based on their names or other criteria that determine method equality, rather than using the default `equals` method that checks for reference equality. This way, the test case can verify the method invocation correctly.
