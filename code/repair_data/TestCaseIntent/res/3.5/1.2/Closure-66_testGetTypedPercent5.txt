Analysis: The purpose of the failed test case `testGetTypedPercent5` is to check the percentage of typed code in the provided JavaScript code. The test expects the typed percentage to be 100.0 with a tolerance of 0.1.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(100.0, getTypedPercent(js), 0.1);` failed because the actual typed percentage calculated by the `getTypedPercent` method did not match the expected value within the allowed tolerance.

Possible reasons for the failure:
1. The `getTypedPercent` method might not correctly calculate the typed percentage in the given JavaScript code.
2. There could be a discrepancy in how the typed percentage is calculated compared to the expected result in the test case.
3. There might be an issue with the enumeration type declaration `{A: 1, B: 2, C: 3}` in the provided JavaScript code that affects the typed percentage calculation.

Further investigation into the implementation of the `getTypedPercent` method and how it calculates the typed percentage based on the JavaScript code is necessary to identify the exact cause of the test failure.
