Analysis: The purpose of the `cumulativeProbability` method is to calculate the cumulative probability for a given value in a normal distribution. The intent is to return the cumulative probability based on the input value.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(distribution.cumulativeProbability(Double.MAX_VALUE), 1, 0);` failed because the method is not handling extreme values like `Double.MAX_VALUE` correctly. The calculation using `Double.MAX_VALUE` is causing issues, possibly due to overflow or precision errors, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the issue, you may need to handle extreme values like `Double.MAX_VALUE` appropriately in the `cumulativeProbability` method to ensure correct calculations and prevent errors related to overflow or precision.
