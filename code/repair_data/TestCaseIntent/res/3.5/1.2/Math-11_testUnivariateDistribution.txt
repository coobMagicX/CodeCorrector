Analysis: The purpose of the code snippet is to calculate the density of a multivariate normal distribution given the values and covariance matrix. The intent is to compare the density values of a univariate normal distribution and a multivariate normal distribution for various input values.

The specific failed line `Assert.assertEquals(uni.density(v), multi.density(new double[] { v }), tol);` failed during testing because the density calculation for the multivariate normal distribution might not be implemented correctly. This could be due to issues in the calculation of the exponent term or the covariance matrix determinant, leading to incorrect density values being returned. 

To fix this issue, you should review the implementation of the `getExponentTerm` method and ensure that the covariance matrix determinant calculation is accurate. Additionally, check if the calculation of the density for the multivariate normal distribution is consistent with the expected results based on the input values provided.
