Analysis: The purpose of the `doSolve` method is to iteratively find a root of a univariate real function within specified accuracies and constraints. The method implements the Regula Falsi algorithm to refine the approximation of the root until it meets the desired criteria.

Specifically for the failed line `final double root = solver.solve(3624, f, 1, 10);`, the reason it failed in the test case is likely due to the initial interval provided for the solver being too large or not properly bracketing the root of the function `f`. This caused the Regula Falsi algorithm to not converge to the expected root within the specified tolerance of `1e-15`.

To address this issue, you may need to adjust the initial interval or provide a better initial guess to help the solver converge to the desired root more effectively.
