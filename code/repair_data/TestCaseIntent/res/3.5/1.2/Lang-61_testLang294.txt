Analysis: The purpose of the `deleteAll` method in the `StrBuilder` class is to remove all occurrences of a specified string from the `StrBuilder` object. The intent behind calling `sb.deleteAll("\n%BLAH%")` in the test case is to delete all occurrences of the string "\n%BLAH%" from the `StrBuilder` object `sb`.

Reasons for the specific line failure:
1. The implementation of the `deleteAll` method in the `StrBuilder` class may not be correctly handling the deletion of the specified string "\n%BLAH%" from the `StrBuilder` object. This could be due to a logic error or a bug in the `deleteAll` method.
2. The `indexOf` method within the `StrBuilder` class may not be returning the correct index for the occurrences of the specified string "\n%BLAH%", leading to the deletion not happening as expected.

To fix the issue, you should review the implementation of the `deleteAll` method in the `StrBuilder` class and ensure that it correctly handles the deletion of the specified string. Additionally, check the `indexOf` method to make sure it returns the correct index for the occurrences of the specified string.
