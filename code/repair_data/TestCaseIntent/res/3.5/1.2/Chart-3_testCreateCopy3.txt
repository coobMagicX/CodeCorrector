Analysis: The purpose of the `createCopy` method is to create a copy of a specific range of data points from a `TimeSeries` object. The method is expected to return a new `TimeSeries` object containing data points within the specified range.

Reason for failure on `assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON)`: 
The specific line failed because the `createCopy` method did not correctly copy the data points as expected. It seems that the copy operation within the loop is not including the end index specified in the method call, causing the copied `TimeSeries` object to miss the last data point.

To fix the issue, the loop in the `createCopy` method should be adjusted to include the `end` index when copying the data points:
```java
for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {
    // Copy data points from start to end index (inclusive)
}
```

By ensuring that the loop includes the `end` index when copying the data points, the copied `TimeSeries` object will contain all the data points within the specified range, and the test case should pass successfully.
