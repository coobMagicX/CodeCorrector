Analysis: The intent of the failed test case is to test the serialization and deserialization process of a `ShapeList` object. The `assertEquals(l1, l2)` line is supposed to verify that the deserialized `ShapeList` object `l2` is equal to the original `ShapeList` object `l1`.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class is not implemented correctly to handle the comparison of two `ShapeList` objects during deserialization and testing for equality. The default implementation from the superclass `Object` is not suitable for comparing the contents of `ShapeList`.
2. The `equals` method should check for equality of individual elements within the `ShapeList` objects rather than delegating to the superclass implementation.
3. Since the `ShapeList` class does not override the `equals` method to provide custom equality comparison logic, the default behavior of comparing object references is used, which is not suitable for comparing the contents of the `ShapeList` objects.

To fix this issue, you need to override the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class to compare the contents of the `ShapeList` objects correctly. This custom `equals` method should iterate over the elements in the `ShapeList` and compare them individually to ensure equality based on the contained shapes.
