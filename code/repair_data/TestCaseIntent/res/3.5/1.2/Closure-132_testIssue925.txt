Analysis: The purpose of the `tryMinimizeIf` method is to optimize if-else statements by transforming them into more compact forms, such as ternary expressions or combining similar assignments. The specific failed line in the test cases indicates that the method failed to transform if-else statements into ternary expressions in some cases.

The specific line failing the test cases is in the `testIssue925` test case:
```java
test("if (x++) { x += 2 } else { x += 3 }", "x++ ? x += 2 : x += 3");
```

Reasons for failure:
1. In the failed test case, the `tryMinimizeIf` method does not handle the case where the expressions inside the if-else branches involve compound assignment operators (`+=`) correctly.
2. The transformation logic in the method does not properly handle the scenario where the same variable is modified with different compound operations in the if and else branches.

To address the issue, the `tryMinimizeIf` method needs to be enhanced to correctly handle compound assignment operators and ensure proper transformation of if-else statements involving such operators into ternary expressions.
