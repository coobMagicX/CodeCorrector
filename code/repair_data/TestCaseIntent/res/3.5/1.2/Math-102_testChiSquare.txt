Analysis: The purpose of the `chiSquare` method is to calculate the chi-square statistic given arrays of expected and observed values. The intent is to compare how well the observed values fit the expected values based on a statistical test.

The specific failed line `assertEquals( "chi-square test statistic", 9.023307936427388, TestUtils.chiSquare(expected1, observed1), 1E-10)` failed because the expected chi-square test statistic value `9.023307936427388` did not match the actual calculated value returned by the `chiSquare` method for the input arrays `expected1` and `observed1`. 

The reason for this failure could be due to the calculation of the chi-square statistic within the `chiSquare` method. Possible reasons for the discrepancy could include incorrect formula implementation, incorrect handling of deviations, or issues with the expected and observed values. It is recommended to review the calculation logic within the `chiSquare` method to ensure it aligns with the expected chi-square statistic computation.
