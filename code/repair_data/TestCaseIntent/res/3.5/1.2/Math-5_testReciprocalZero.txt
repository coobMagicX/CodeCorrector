Analysis: The purpose of the `reciprocal()` method is to calculate the reciprocal of a complex number. The failed test case `testReciprocalZero()` is attempting to validate that the reciprocal of the complex number zero should be `Complex.INF` (infinity).

Reasons for failure:
1. The specific failed line `Assert.assertEquals(Complex.ZERO.reciprocal(), Complex.INF);` fails because the method is returning `Complex.NaN` for a complex number with both real and imaginary parts as 0.0. The expected result `Complex.INF` is not being returned for this case.
2. The method does not handle the case of reciprocal of zero correctly, as it currently returns `Complex.NaN` instead of `Complex.INF` for a complex number with both real and imaginary parts as 0.0.

To fix the issue, the `reciprocal()` method should be modified to correctly handle the reciprocal of zero by returning `Complex.INF` instead of `Complex.NaN` for a complex number with both real and imaginary parts as 0.0.
