Analysis: The purpose of the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method is to retrieve the remaining JSDoc line from a stream. In the failed test case, the issue lies in the specific JSDoc line being parsed.

The specific failed line `parse("@return {@code foo} bar \n *    baz. */"` seems to contain a JSDoc comment intended for documenting a return value. The failure is likely due to the incorrect format of the JSDoc comment. 

Possible reasons for the failure could include:
1. Missing opening JSDoc comment delimiter '/*' at the beginning of the comment.
2. The line may not follow the standard JSDoc syntax for documenting return values, leading to a syntax error.
3. Incorrect placement or formatting of tags like '@return' or '{@code}' causing the parser to fail in recognizing the type annotation.

To resolve the issue, ensure that the JSDoc comment follows the correct syntax and format conventions for documenting return values in JavaScript code.
