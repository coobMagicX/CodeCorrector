Analysis: The purpose of the `testConstrainedRosenWithMoreInterpolationPoints` test case is to test the behavior of the optimization algorithm with more interpolation points added incrementally. The intent is to verify the optimization process with varying numbers of interpolation points.

The specific failed line `doTest(new Rosen(), startPoint, boundaries,` failed because the test case failed for the expected number of additional interpolation points. The test is supposed to iterate over additional interpolation points up to a calculated maximum value, but it is failing with values below the expected threshold. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the calculation of the maximum additional points or the test setup.

It is likely that the calculation of `maxAdditionalPoints` based on `((DIM + 1) * (DIM + 2)) / 2 - (2 * DIM + 1)` is incorrect or not aligning with the expected behavior of the optimization algorithm. Further investigation into the calculation logic or the behavior of the algorithm with varying numbers of interpolation points is needed to address this failure.
