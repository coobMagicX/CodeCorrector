Analysis: The purpose of the `add` method is to add a value to a specific field of a `ReadablePartial` object. The method handles scenarios where the value to add is not zero, and applies the addition based on the field type and chronology of the partial object. If the partial object is contiguous (e.g., month-day fields), it calculates the new instant after the addition and returns the updated partial object. Otherwise, it delegates the addition to the superclass implementation.

Reason for failure: The specific line `MonthDay result = test.minusDays(-1);` failed in the test case `testMinusDays_int_negativeFromLeap` because the `minusDays` method is not correctly handling the negative value passed as an argument. In this case, the intent was to subtract 1 day from the given `MonthDay` object, but the implementation did not handle negative values properly, leading to an incorrect result. The method likely did not account for negative values in the logic for subtracting days.
