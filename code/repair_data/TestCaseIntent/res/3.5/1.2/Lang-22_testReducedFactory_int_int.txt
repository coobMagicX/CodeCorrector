Analysis: The purpose of the `greatestCommonDivisor` method is to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. The failed line `assertEquals(Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2, f.getNumerator());` indicates that the test case is expecting the numerator of a reduced fraction to be equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2`, but the test fails.

Reasons for failure:
1. The method `Fraction.getReducedFraction(int, int)` that calculates the reduced fraction might not be correctly reducing the fraction before returning it.
2. There could be an issue with the calculation or handling of extreme values like `Integer.MIN_VALUE` in the method, leading to incorrect results.
3. The implementation of the greatest common divisor calculation within the `Fraction` class might not be handling extreme values properly, resulting in incorrect reductions.

To address the failure, you should investigate the `Fraction` class and its methods related to fraction reduction, handling extreme values, and the implementation of the greatest common divisor calculation. Check for any logic errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.
