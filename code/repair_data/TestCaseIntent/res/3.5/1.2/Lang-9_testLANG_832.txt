Analysis: The purpose of the code snippet is to parse a pattern and extract strategies based on the format fields. The specific failed line is trying to test for an unterminated quote in the pattern.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed the test because the pattern `'d'd'` contains an unterminated quote. The code logic in the method is not handling this scenario correctly, leading to an error in parsing the pattern with an unmatched quote. The regular expression generation logic in the method does not account for this edge case, causing the test to fail. To fix this issue, the code should be updated to handle unterminated quotes in the pattern properly.
