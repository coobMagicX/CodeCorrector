Analysis: The purpose of the `isInlinableObject` method is to determine if a given list of references corresponds to an object literal assignment that can be safely inlined. The method checks various conditions to ensure that the assignment is valid for inlining.

The specific failed line `testLocal("var a; a = {x:1, y:2}; f(a.x, a.y2);",` failed because the method incorrectly returns `false` for the object literal assignment `a = {x:1, y:2};`. This leads to the test case failing even though the assignment should be considered valid for inlining.

The reason for the failure is in the condition where the method checks if the assigned value is an object literal. In this case, the method incorrectly returns `false` for the assignment `a = {x:1, y:2};` because it expects `a.y2` to be a valid reference within the object literal. However, `a.y2` is not a valid reference in the object literal, leading to the incorrect rejection of the assignment. 

To address this issue, the method should be updated to correctly handle object literal assignments where the assigned property names are not valid references in the object literal.
