Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation based on certain conditions and matchers. The method handles capturing arguments when dealing with varargs and normal arguments. 

The specific failed line `String result = mixedVarargs.doSomething("hello",(String[]) null);` indicates an issue with capturing varargs arguments correctly, as the test case involves using mixed varargs. 

Reasons for failure:
1. The method `captureArgumentsFrom` does not handle capturing varargs arguments correctly when mixed with normal arguments. It fails to properly iterate over the varargs array and capture each element individually.
2. The check for varargs and varargs matchers in the method may not be correctly identifying and handling the mixed varargs scenario, leading to incorrect argument capturing. 
3. The implementation of capturing varargs may need to be revised to handle mixed varargs scenarios more effectively.
