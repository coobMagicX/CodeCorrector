**Analysis:** The purpose of the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method is to determine if a given node evaluates to a local value based on certain conditions related to the type of the node and its children.

The specific failed line `checkMarkedCalls("new externObjSEThis().externObjSEThisMethod('')"` failed because the method `evaluatesToLocalValue` is not handling the case of a `NEW` token correctly. In the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method, for the `Token.NEW` case, the method always returns `true`, which indicates that the value is considered local. However, the comment in the code suggests that this behavior needs to be changed so that it returns `true` only if the value was never aliased from inside the constructor.

Therefore, in the context of the failed test case, the `NEW` token for `new externObjSEThis().externObjSEThisMethod('')` is not being correctly evaluated as a local value as intended based on the comment.

The handling of the `Token.NEW` case in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method needs to be modified to consider whether the value was aliased from inside the constructor, as mentioned in the comment. This change will ensure that the method behaves as expected in scenarios like the failed test case.
