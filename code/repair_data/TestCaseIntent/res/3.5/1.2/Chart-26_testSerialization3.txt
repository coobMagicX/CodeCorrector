Analysis: The purpose of the `testSerialization3` test case is to serialize and deserialize a `JFreeChart` object and then check if the deserialized chart is still usable by creating a buffered image from it. The intent is to ensure that the serialization process does not affect the usability of the chart object.

Reasons for the failure at the specific line `assertTrue(passed);`:
The failure at this specific line indicates that the `passed` variable is false, meaning that an exception occurred when attempting to create a buffered image from the deserialized `JFreeChart` object `chart2`. This failure could be due to an issue during the deserialization process that corrupted the deserialized object or its internal state, making it unable to create a buffered image successfully. To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to investigate the deserialization process and potential errors that might have occurred during it.
