Analysis: The purpose of the method is to find the root of a function within a given interval using the Brent method. The intent is to handle cases where the function values at the endpoints of the interval do not have different signs, indicating that the interval does not bracket the root.

The specific line `result = solver.solve(3, Math.PI);` failed because the function values at the endpoints `f.value(3)` and `f.value(Math.PI)` do not have different signs, violating the requirement for bracketing the root. This leads to the IllegalArgumentException being thrown, as the interval does not contain a root.

To address this issue, you may need to revise the test case to provide an interval where the function values at the endpoints have different signs to properly bracket the root.
