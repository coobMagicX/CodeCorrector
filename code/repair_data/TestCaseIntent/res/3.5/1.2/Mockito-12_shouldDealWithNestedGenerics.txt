**Analysis:** The purpose of the `getGenericType` method is to return the actual Class type of a generic field. The method specifically handles nested generics up to one level.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(Set.class, m.getGenericType(field("nested")));` failed because the method did not correctly handle nested generics. It returned `Object.class` instead of the expected `Set.class` due to the limitation of the implementation to handle only one level of nesting.

Additionally, the test case `shouldDealWithNestedGenerics` failed for the same reason, indicating that the method does not support multiple levels of nested generics, as seen in the `multiNested` field.

**Reasons for Failure:**
1. The method implementation only handles one level of nested generics, so it fails to correctly identify the class type for multiple levels of nesting.
2. The method returns `Object.class` as a fallback when encountering nested generics beyond the first level, leading to incorrect results in the test case.
