Analysis: The purpose of the method `evaluatesToLocalValue` is to determine if a given node represents a local value based on certain conditions and rules. The failed line `assertFalse(testLocalValue("new x()"))` is testing whether the creation of a new object is considered a local value, where the test should return `false`.

Reasons for failure:
1. In the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method, for the case `Token.NEW`, the current implementation returns `true` unconditionally. This means that the method is not correctly handling the case where a new object is created, and it always assumes it to be a local value.
2. The test case is expecting the creation of a new object to be considered a non-local value, but the method implementation is not reflecting this distinction.

To address this issue, the implementation in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method for the case `Token.NEW` should be modified to properly evaluate whether the new object creation should be treated as a local value or not based on the defined conditions.
