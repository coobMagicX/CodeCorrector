Analysis: The purpose of the method `computeMillis` is to calculate the milliseconds value based on the input data and saved fields. The failed test case `testParseLocalDate_year_month_week_2011` is testing the parsing of a local date using a specific format. The specific failed line `assertEquals(new LocalDate(2011, 1, 3, chrono), f.parseLocalDate("2011-01-01"))` is comparing the parsed LocalDate object with an expected value, but it fails.

Reason for failure: The failure might be due to the handling of week-based year and week fields in the parsing logic. The input date "2011-01-01" corresponds to the first week of the year 2011, but the parsing logic in the `computeMillis` method may not correctly handle the week-based year and week fields, leading to an incorrect result. This discrepancy causes the test case to fail at the specific assertion line.
