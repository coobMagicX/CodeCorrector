Analysis: The purpose of the `testIssue787` test case is to check if a given piece of JavaScript code is transformed correctly into a specific result using certain compiler options. The `test` method is used to compare the expected result with the actual transformation result.

The specific failed line `test(options, code, result);` failed because the `test` method did not produce the expected result as defined in the `result` string. This could be due to issues in the transformation logic or incorrect handling of the JavaScript code during the compilation process. Further investigation into the transformation process and the comparison logic in the `test` method is needed to identify the exact reason for the failure.
