Analysis: The purpose of the tryFoldShift method is to perform bitwise shift operations on two integer operands and handle potential errors related to operand ranges and shift amounts. The method converts the operands to integers, checks if they are within the valid range, performs the shift operation based on the operator, and returns the result.

Specific failed line (fold("x = -1 >>> 0", "x = 4294967295")):
- The failed line attempts to perform an unsigned right shift operation (>>> operator) on the integer -1 (represented as a double) by 0 bits. The expected result is 4294967295 (0xffffffff in hexadecimal).

Reason for failure:
- The specific line failed because the method incorrectly handles the case where the operand for the unsigned right shift operation is a negative value. In Java, the unsigned right shift operator (>>>) should treat the operand as if it were an unsigned value, but the current implementation of the method does not consider this behavior. As a result, the method does not produce the expected result of 4294967295, leading to the test case failure. 

To fix this issue, you should update the method to correctly handle negative values for the unsigned right shift operation by converting the negative operand to its unsigned equivalent before performing the shift.
