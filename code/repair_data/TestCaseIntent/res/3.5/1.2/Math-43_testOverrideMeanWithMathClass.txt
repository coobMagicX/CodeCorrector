Analysis: The purpose of the `addValue` method is to increment various statistical values such as sum, minimum, maximum, etc., based on the input value. Additionally, it increments the mean, variance, and geometric mean if they have not been overridden. 

The specific line `Assert.assertEquals((new Mean()).evaluate(scores), stats.getMean(), 0);` failed because the expected mean value calculated using the `Mean` class's `evaluate` method does not match the actual mean value stored in the `SummaryStatistics` object.

Reasons:
1. The test case sets the mean implementation of the `SummaryStatistics` object to a new instance of `Mean`, but it doesn't ensure that the mean calculation method in the `Mean` class is compatible with the way mean is calculated and stored in the `SummaryStatistics` object.
2. The `Mean` instance created in the test case might be using a different calculation method or have different internal state compared to the `meanImpl` object in the `SummaryStatistics` object.
3. There could be a discrepancy in how the mean is calculated or stored between the `Mean` class and the `SummaryStatistics` class, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual mean values.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the mean calculation method in the `Mean` class aligns with the mean calculation and storage mechanism used in the `SummaryStatistics` class. Additionally, verify that the mean implementation set in the `SummaryStatistics` object is compatible with the expected mean calculation method for accurate comparison in the test case.
