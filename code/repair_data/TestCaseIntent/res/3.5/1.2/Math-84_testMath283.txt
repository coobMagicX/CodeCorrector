Analysis: The intent of the `iterateSimplex` method is to iterate through the simplex and perform reflection, expansion, and contraction steps in a multi-directional optimization algorithm. The specific line that failed the test case is trying to optimize a function using the `MultiDirectional` optimizer.

Reasons for failure: The test case failed because the `iterateSimplex` method is causing an infinite loop due to the `while (true)` loop, which never breaks unless explicitly returned. This prevents the convergence check from being properly executed, leading to the algorithm looping forever. To fix this issue, the `while (true)` loop should be replaced with a convergence check to ensure that the optimization process stops when certain conditions are met.

To address the issue and enable the convergence check, you can modify the `iterateSimplex` method to include a condition that checks for convergence based on the specified criteria (e.g., maximum number of iterations or evaluations). This will prevent the algorithm from looping indefinitely and allow the optimization process to terminate appropriately once the convergence criteria are satisfied.
