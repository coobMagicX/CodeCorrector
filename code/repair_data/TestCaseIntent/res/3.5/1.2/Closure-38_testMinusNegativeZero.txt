Analysis: The purpose of the `addNumber` method is to add a number to the current output stream while handling special cases like negative zero and pretty printing for better readability. The failed test case `testMinusNegativeZero` is trying to assert that the method correctly handles the case when a negative zero is encountered.

The specific failed line `assertPrint("x- -0", "x- -0.0");` indicates that the expected output after adding the number `-0` should be `x- -0.0`. However, the test failed because the method did not handle the negative zero case correctly and did not convert `-0` to `-0.0` as expected.

Reason for failure: The method does not specifically handle the case of negative zero (`-0`) to convert it to a string representation with the decimal point (`-0.0`). This lack of handling results in the test case failing to produce the expected output. To fix this issue, the method should have a special case to convert negative zero to its proper string representation when adding the number to the output stream.
