Analysis: The purpose of the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method is to remove unreferenced function arguments from a given function scope. The intent is to optimize the function by removing unused arguments, which can help reduce the size of the code and improve performance.

Reasons for the specific failed line (`testSame("window.f = function(a) {};"`) failing the test case:
1. The test case is using `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation level, which implies that the compiler should leave unused parameters in the function intact.
2. The function `window.f` is defined with a single argument `a`, but this argument is not used within the function body. Since the test is expecting the unused parameter `a` to be preserved, the removal of it by the method causes the test to fail.

To pass the test case, the method should be modified or the test case adjusted to ensure that unused parameters are not removed when using `SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation level.
