Analysis: The purpose of the `checkParameters` method is to validate input parameters before performing optimization using the CMAESOptimizer. It checks for finite and infinite bounds, handles boundaries, and validates input sigma values. The specific failed line `final double[] result = optimizer.optimize(10000, fitnessFunction, GoalType.MINIMIZE,` indicates a failure in optimizing with boundary ranges that are too large.

Reasons for failure:
1. The failure occurs because the difference between the upper and lower bounds is too large, causing overflow during normalization of variables in the optimization process.
2. The `FastMath.nextUp(max)` method is used to create a value that is very close to `Double.MAX_VALUE`, which is a very large number. This large difference between upper and lower bounds causes issues during optimization.
3. The optimization algorithm cannot handle such large boundary ranges, leading to a failure in the optimization process. 

To address this issue, the boundary ranges should be adjusted to be within a reasonable range that the optimization algorithm can handle effectively. This may involve scaling down the ranges or using a different optimization approach suitable for handling such large ranges.
