Analysis: The purpose of the `computeFollowNode` method is to determine the next node to transfer control to in a given control flow scenario within an abstract syntax tree (AST). It handles various cases such as returning to the end of a script, back to a function caller, or following specific control flow structures like `IF`, `CASE`, `FOR`, `WHILE`, `DO`, `TRY`, etc. The method aims to identify the appropriate node to continue the control flow analysis.

The specific failed line `testNotMissing(` in the test case indicates that the test is failing to check for the expected result of the `computeFollowNode` method. This failure could be due to various reasons such as incorrect expectations in the test case, unexpected behavior in the method, or issues with the control flow logic within the method.

To further investigate the cause of the test failure, you may need to review the expected behavior of the `computeFollowNode` method and compare it with the actual output for the given input scenario in the test case. Additionally, debugging the method execution with the provided input could help identify any discrepancies or errors in the control flow logic that lead to the test failure.
