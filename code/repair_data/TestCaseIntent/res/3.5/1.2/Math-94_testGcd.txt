Analysis: The purpose of the `gcd` method is to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The specific line that failed in the test case `assertEquals(3 * (1<<15), MathUtils.gcd(3 * (1<<20), 9 * (1<<15)))` indicates that the gcd calculation did not return the expected result.

Reasons for failure: The failure in the specific line is likely due to the fact that the `gcd` method can encounter an overflow when calculating the result. In the `gcd` method, there is a check for overflow when `k` reaches 31, and an `ArithmeticException` is thrown. However, in this specific test case, the values passed as arguments (`3 * (1<<20)` and `9 * (1<<15)`) result in an overflow situation that is not handled correctly. The method should handle such cases by either adjusting the input values or implementing a different approach to prevent overflow during the calculation.
