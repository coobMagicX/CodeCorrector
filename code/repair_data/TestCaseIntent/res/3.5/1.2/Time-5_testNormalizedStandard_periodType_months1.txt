Analysis: The purpose of the `normalizedStandard` method is to normalize the Period object based on the provided PeriodType. The method calculates the total milliseconds in the period and then adjusts the years and months accordingly.

The specific failed line `Period result = test.normalizedStandard(PeriodType.months());` failed because the method `normalizedStandard` did not correctly adjust the months when the months value exceeded 12. 

The reason for the failure is that the calculation for adjusting months in the method is incorrect. When the months value is 15 in the test case, it should be converted to 3 years and 3 months (15 months = 1 year + 3 months). However, the current implementation only handles the case of months within a single year, leading to the failure in the test case. 

To fix the issue, the method should properly handle the case where the months value exceeds 12 by converting the excess months to years and adjusting the remaining months accordingly.
