**Analysis:** The purpose of the `toJavaVersionInt` method is to convert a Java version string into an integer representation. The method seems to extract the version information and convert it to an integer.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(0, SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt(null));` fails because the method is not handling the case when the input `version` is `null` properly. 

**Reasons for failure:** The method `toJavaVersionInt` directly calls `toJavaVersionIntArray` with the input `version`, which leads to a `NullPointerException` when `version` is `null`. This causes the test case to fail as it expects the result to be `0` for a `null` input. 

To fix this issue, the method should check for `null` input at the beginning and return `0` if the input is `null`.
