Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and handle varargs if present. The specific failed line `verify(mock).withBooleanVarargs(1);` indicates a failure in verifying the method call with specific arguments.

Reasons for failure: The failure occurs because the test is expecting the method `withBooleanVarargs` to be called with only one argument (1), but the actual invocation might have had more arguments passed, leading to a mismatch in the verification. This discrepancy triggers an `ArgumentsAreDifferent` exception, causing the test case to fail. 

To resolve this issue, you may need to adjust the verification to match the actual arguments passed during the method invocation in the test case.
