Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the `toClass` method correctly transforms an array of objects into an array of their respective classes, including handling `null` values within the array by corresponding them to `null` classes.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle `null` objects within the input array by assigning `null` to the respective index in the classes array, rather than trying to invoke `getClass()` on a `null` object which will cause a NullPointerException. Modify the loop inside the `toClass` method to check if each object in the array is `null` before calling `getClass()`.
