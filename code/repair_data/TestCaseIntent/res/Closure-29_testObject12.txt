Intent: The intent of the test case `testObject12` is to verify the functionality of handling object literals and their properties correctly. It tests whether the code can properly handle an object `a` being assigned properties `x` and `y`, and subsequently accessing these properties (including a typo in the property name `y2` which should not exist as per the assignment).

Repair strategy: Enhance the source code to correctly handle cases where properties being accessed do not exist on the object. This might involve adding additional checks to verify if a property exists on the object before proceeding with operations on it. Additionally, managing typos or incorrect properties gracefully could be part of the repair strategy, either by throwing meaningful errors or handling them without causing failures.
