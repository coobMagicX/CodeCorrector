Intent: The test case `testInlineFunctions6` intends to inline a function `BAR_FN` that takes three parameters and applies the third parameter as a function on the result of another function `foo` applied to the sum of the first two parameters. The inlining should replace the call to `BAR_FN` with the direct application of `baz` to `foo(x + y)`.

Repair strategy: The source code likely fails to handle cases where parameters of the function are themselves functions that are used to process the output of other functions within the function body. The repair should include enhancements in the source code to support the inlining of function parameters that are used as functional arguments within the return statement of the function. This will involve ensuring that when a function parameter is a higher-order function (i.e., a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function), the inlining logic correctly handles the transfer of the actual function (like `baz` in the test case) into the function call site. Additionally, ensure that any side-effects or state mutations caused by such functional arguments are accurately accounted for in the inlining process.
