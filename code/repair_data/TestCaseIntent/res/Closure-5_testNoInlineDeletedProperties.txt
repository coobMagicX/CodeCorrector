Intent: The test case `testNoInlineDeletedProperties` is designed to ensure that properties of an object which have been deleted are not considered for inlining. The test verifies that after a property is deleted from an object, any subsequent access to that property does not result in it being inlined, preserving the correct semantics of the `delete` operation.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isInlinableObject` function to track if a property has been deleted and prevent such properties from being considered valid for inlining. The function should include a mechanism to maintain a record of deleted properties and check this record when determining if a property can be inlined. This will ensure that deleted properties are correctly handled and not mistakenly inlined, allowing the source code to pass the test case.
