Intent: The intent of the test case `testJira567` is to validate the functionality of the `addAll` method in handling arrays of different but compatible types (such as `Integer` and `Long`, both extending `Number`), and to ensure that an exception is thrown when attempting to join arrays of incompatible element types where one cannot be stored in the other (e.g., storing `Long` in an `Integer` array).

Repair strategy: Modify the `addAll` method to dynamically determine the most specific common superclass of the component types of the two input arrays. This adjustment should handle cases where the types are different but compatible, allowing for the creation of an array that can store elements of both input arrays without type conflicts. This can be implemented by comparing the component types of the provided arrays and selecting a type that can hold all elements, such as `Number` in the case of `Integer` and `Long`. Additionally, proper exception handling should be added or confirmed to ensure that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when no common superclass exists that can accommodate both types.
