Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue303` is to verify the accuracy of the function `checkMarkedCalls` in detecting whether the calls within the JavaScript function `F` and its prototype method `setLocation` are correctly marked based on the annotations and context given. Specifically, it seems to assess how changes in a constructor function and asynchronous callbacks affect the locality and mutability of object properties within the function scope.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to correctly handle assignments in asynchronous callbacks and constructors in the context of locality. One potential issue could be the handling of `this` and properties of `this` in different contexts (like asynchronous functions and constructors), which seems not to be properly determined in the current implementation. The repair should focus on enhancing the function `evaluatesToLocalValue` to better manage the scope and mutability of properties on object instances, particularly when modified inside asynchronous callbacks and constructors. A detailed look at how `locals.apply(value)` and `evaluatesToLocalValue(value.getLastChild(), locals)` are evaluated for object properties and their changes in different scopes (like within `setTimeout` callbacks) should be considered. Additionally, there should be a verification mechanism to ensure that modifications to object properties do not falsely assume local immutability or state confinement when such properties are exposed or can be altered externally.
