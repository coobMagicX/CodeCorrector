Intent: The intent of the failed test case `TestLang747` is to ensure that hexadecimal numbers are accurately parsed and converted into the appropriate numeric type (Integer, Long, or BigInteger) based on their value and size.

Repair strategy: The code should be adjusted to correctly handle the sizing and conversion logic for hexadecimal numbers, taking into account the number of hex digits and their corresponding value ranges. Specifically, the logic that determines whether a number should be parsed as an Integer, Long, or BigInteger needs to be correctly implemented to handle edge cases and numbers on the boundary of these ranges. The parsing mechanism should correctly interpret hexadecimal values based on their length and prefix, properly accounting for leading zeros which do not affect the numeric value but do affect the choice of numeric type (Integer, Long, or BigInteger). Adjustments should also ensure that the entire string, including prefixes and leading zeros, is considered when determining the length and thus the appropriate data type.
