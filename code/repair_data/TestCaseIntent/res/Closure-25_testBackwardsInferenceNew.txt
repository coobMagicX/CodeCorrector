Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the type inference mechanism correctly updates the type of variable `y` based on the type requirements of the constructor `F`. The constructor `F` expects an object with a property `foo` that can either be a number or undefined. The test checks if the system accurately infers and updates the type of `y` after it is passed to `new F(y)`.

Repair strategy: Check and modify the type inference and updating mechanism in the `traverseNew` function to ensure that objects passed to constructors have their types updated appropriately based on the parameter definitions of the constructor. This may involve ensuring that the type of the argument (`y` in this case) is correctly modified in the scope to match the type specified in the constructor's documentation (`{foo: (number|undefined)}`). This can be achieved by improving how the instance types are derived from constructor functions and ensuring that these derived types are correctly applied to the arguments passed to the constructor. Additionally, verify and possibly correct the propagation of these types back to the variables in the outer scope.
