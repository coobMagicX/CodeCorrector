Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue297e` is to verify the correct handling of variable assignment and usage within a single expression to ensure that the transformations in variable liveness (READ, KILL, MAYBE_LIVE) are accurately captured, especially in situations where a variable is assigned and then immediately used in subsequent operations within the same expression.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to correctly determine the state of variable liveness when a variable is both assigned and read within the same expression. The current logic potentially misinterprets the sequence of READ and KILL states when assignments and subsequent usages are closely nested. Adjust the handling in the `isVariableReadBeforeKill` function to more accurately reflect these scenarios by ensuring that the KILL state does not overwrite a READ state that occurs after an assignment within the same expression. This might involve refining the logic that decides when to return KILL versus READ to account for the immediate evaluation context of the variable, especially in compound expressions like the one in the test case.
