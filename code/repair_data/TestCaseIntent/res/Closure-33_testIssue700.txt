Intent: The test case `testIssue700` aims to validate the handling of JavaScript functions that involve parameter object type constraints, specifically verifying that the function `matchConstraint` correctly processes and matches property types in object literals as specified in function parameter type annotations.

Repair strategy: The `matchConstraint` method should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure it accurately checks and infers types for properties of passed objects, particularly in complex scenarios where properties can have multiple possible types (e.g., union types like boolean|number|string|null|Object in `temp2`). The method must handle cases where the property type is not straightforward (like single primitive types) and ensure proper type inference and declaration irrespective of the property's complexity in type. Additionally, the method should correctly handle cases where no explicit property type is declared (handling of undefined types) and still ensure the object matches the expected constraints. Consider implementing or refining the logic that handles type superposition or union types more robustly.
