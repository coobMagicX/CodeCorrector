Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLANG_832` is to validate the format pattern handling in the `init` method, specifically focusing on patterns involving quotes. The test aims to ensure that the method correctly handles cases of unterminated quotes in the pattern string.

Repair strategy: Modify the `init` method to include a validation check for properly terminated quotes within the format pattern. This could involve implementing a mechanism to track the state of quotation marks (open or close) as the pattern is parsed and raising an exception if the pattern ends with an open quote. Alternatively, enhancing the regex used in the `formatPattern.matcher(pattern)` to detect and reject unterminated quotes could also be a viable strategy.
