Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testSyntaxError2` is to verify that the method `extractMessage` correctly handles a JavaScript syntax error by throwing a RuntimeException with a detailed error message that includes the line of code with the error and the specific error message.

Repair strategy: Review the `extractMessage` method to ensure it properly identifies syntax errors in JavaScript code and formats the error message to include the specific line of code where the error occurs. The method should correctly extract and include the erroneous line in the exception message as expected by the test case. If the method does not currently handle the extraction and formatting of error messages correctly, modify it to parse the input code, detect syntax errors, and output a detailed and correctly formatted error message. Ensure that line numbers and error specifics are accurately represented in the output.
