Intent: The intent of the test case `testGetTypedPercent6` is to ensure that the percentage of the JavaScript code that has been successfully typed is 100%. The code snippet being tested is an object literal with properties `TRUE` and `FALSE` set to numeric values.

Repair strategy: Inspect and modify the handling of object literals in the `visit` method to ensure that they are correctly typed as `OBJECTLIT` and that their keys (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) are recognized as typeable when they are indeed typeable. Make sure that the object literals and their properties are being correctly identified and typed, possibly modifying the logic under the `Token.OBJECTLIT` case to handle cases where keys are plain identifiers that are not part of a more complex expression (like an enum or a class). This could involve ensuring that `ensureTyped` is called appropriately for object literals and their keys, and verifying that the type inferencing logic accounts for all properties within an object literal.
