Intent: The method `evaluatesToLocalValue` intends to determine if a given Node in the abstract syntax tree represents a value that is local (i.e., not affected by external states or not referencing non-local variables). This is crucial in optimizations and code transformations where maintaining the locality of variables affects correctness and performance.

Repair strategy: The failing test case `testAnnotationInExterns_new6` suggests that the method incorrectly handles nodes of type `Token.NEW` especially when the constructor modifies `this` but does not have global side-effects. The method currently returns `true` unconditionally for `Token.NEW`, which seems to be an oversimplification. The repair strategy should involve enhancing the handling of `Token.NEW` to check more thoroughly whether the object created by the `new` expression is truly local. This would likely involve analyzing whether the constructor called by the `new` operation modifies any non-local state or has other side-effects that would make the resulting object non-local. Additionally, integrating a check to determine if `this` is modified in a way that affects its locality can help in refining the evaluation. This may require accessing more detailed information about the constructor's behavior or enhancing the predicate logic provided to `evaluatesToLocalValue`.
