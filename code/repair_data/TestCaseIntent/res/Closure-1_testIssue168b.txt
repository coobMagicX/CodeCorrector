Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue168b` is to verify that the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method does not incorrectly remove function arguments that are not directly referenced within the function body but are necessary for maintaining the correct semantics, especially in the context where `removeGlobal` is set to false. The test seems to check that the function's structure and calls are preserved when `removeGlobal` is set to false, ensuring that function calls and parameters remain intact in scenarios where global variable removal is not performed.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the method `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` correctly identifies and retains function arguments that are necessary for the correct execution of the program, regardless of direct referencing within the function body. This could involve enhancing the logic that determines whether an argument is considered "referenced" or not. Specifically, the strategy would involve:
1. Revisiting and potentially refining the conditions under which arguments are considered unreferenced. Ensure that the context of `removeGlobal` being false is properly handled to avoid removing necessary function parameters.
2. Improving the analysis of function calls within other functions to ensure that arguments passed indirectly (e.g., passed but not used directly) are not removed.
3. Ensuring that the logic which checks if function arguments can be safely removed takes into account scenarios where argument removal might change the semantics of function calls, especially in nested or recursive function scenarios.
