Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify that the `reduce` method correctly reduces fractions to their simplest form, ensures proper handling of negative signs, and confirms that the method returns the original object when the fraction is already in simplest form or is zero.

Repair strategy: The potential error in the source code appears to be related to the way the denominator is being managed, particularly in cases involving zero or negative denominators. To resolve these issues:
1. Ensure that the `greatestCommonDivisor` function properly handles cases where the numerator or denominator is zero.
2. Modify the handling of the denominator in the `reduce` method to enforce a consistent sign convention (e.g., denominator always positive).
3. Implement additional checks or adjustments to return the original fraction instance (`this`) when no reduction is needed, as expected in some test assertions using `assertSame`.
4. Review and possibly correct the implementation of `Fraction.ZERO` to ensure it behaves consistently as a singleton or predefined instance representing zero.
