Intent: The intent of the test case `testCall1` is to verify that the `functionCallHasSideEffects` function correctly identifies that a call to `Math.sin(0)` does not have any side effects. The expected outcome of the function, when passed this input, is to return `false`, indicating no side effects.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that built-in functions like those in the "Math" namespace are correctly recognized and handled by the function. Specifically:
1. Add a check to determine if the function belongs to the "Math" namespace and if it is known to be side-effect free.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly identify the namespace and function name combination for built-in functions and ensure that these checks account for different ways these functions might be referenced (e.g., with namespaces, as properties, etc.).
3. Review and possibly extend the list of built-in functions recognized as having no side effects (`BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS_WITHOUT_SIDEEFFECTS`) to include appropriate mathematical and other functions known to not modify state or external variables.
