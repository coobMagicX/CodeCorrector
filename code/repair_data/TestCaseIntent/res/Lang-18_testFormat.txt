Intent: The intent of the test case is to ensure that the custom date formatting implemented by the `FastDateFormat` class matches the output of Javaâ€™s built-in `SimpleDateFormat`, especially when formatting complex patterns involving year, month, day, era, and time zone components. The test checks for consistency in the formatted output between these two formatting systems across different dates and times.

Repair strategy: Investigate and correct the handling of year and era formats in the `FastDateFormat` implementation. Ensure that the year ('y') and era ('G') components are processed and formatted correctly, matching the behavior expected by Java's `SimpleDateFormat`. This might involve adjusting the logic in the `parsePattern` method that interprets and applies formatting rules based on the pattern string. Specifically, verify that the `selectNumberRule` and `TextField` classes are implemented correctly and handle the inputs as expected. Additionally, ensure that logic related to parsing and incrementing the pattern index (using `indexRef`) correctly handles complex patterns, particularly when patterns contain repeated characters or mixed types of format specifiers.
