Intent: The test case `testPropertyOfMethod` intends to verify the function `shouldTraverse` properly allows or disallows traversal of function definitions assigned to properties of a prototype. Specifically, it checks whether the function `shouldTraverse` correctly identifies and handles assignments to prototype properties and sub-properties.

Repair strategy: The failure indicates an issue with string handling in the prototype property detection logic within the `shouldTraverse` function. The source code attempts to prevent traversal of functions assigned to prototype properties, but there seems to be a typo or logical error in handling the string comparison for "prototype". The typo in the test input (`protoype` instead of `prototype`) suggests that the source code might not be robust against slight variations or errors in property naming. The repair should involve:
1. Correcting any typos in the literal strings used for comparisons.
2. Enhancing the logic to more robustly handle different formats or slight variations in specifying prototype properties.
3. Adding additional checks or refining existing conditions to accurately identify assignments to prototype properties and ensure the function's behavior aligns with the specifications and intentions.
