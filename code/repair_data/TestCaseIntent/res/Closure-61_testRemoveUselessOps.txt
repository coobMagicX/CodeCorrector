Intent: The test case `testRemoveUselessOps` is designed to verify that expressions which do not produce side effects and whose results are not used should be optimized away. Specifically, the line `fold("Math.random()", "");` intends to test that calls to `Math.random()` are removed when they are side-effect free.

Repair strategy: Modify the `functionCallHasSideEffects` to correctly identify and handle the case where `Math.random()` is recognized as a function call without side effects. Ensure that built-in functions like `Math.random()` are included in the `BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS_WITHOUT_SIDEEFFECTS` set or correctly identified in another manner within the function to return `false` for side-effect-free calls. Also, ensure the logic correctly parses and evaluates the structure of the function call in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to handle cases where such built-in functions are used.
