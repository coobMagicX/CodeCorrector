Intent: The test case `testIndexOfLang294` is designed to ensure that the `indexOf` method in the `StrBuilder` class correctly returns -1 when searching for a substring ("three") that has been previously removed from the string builder (indicating the substring is no longer present).

Repair strategy: Investigate the `deleteFirst` method to ensure it is correctly removing the specified substring from the string builder's internal buffer. Verify that after deleting, the substring "three" is actually removed and the `size` variable of `StrBuilder` is updated accordingly to reflect the new length of the buffer. Ensure that the `indexOf` method is correctly using the updated `size` and buffer when performing its search. If the buffer or size is not correctly updated after deletion, this could lead to incorrect behavior in the `indexOf` method. Adjust the implementation of either `deleteFirst` or the `indexOf` method or both to ensure consistency between the buffer's content/state and the value returned by `indexOf`.
