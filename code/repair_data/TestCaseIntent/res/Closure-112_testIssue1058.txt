Intent: The test case `testIssue1058` is intended to check if the type inference system correctly handles generic types in JavaScript, especially when dealing with higher-order functions and constructors that use templates. The test aims to validate whether the method `foo` on a templated class `Class` can accept a function argument that uses the class's template type and return a string, contradicting the signature of the passed function `a` which is supposed to return an empty string for a numeric input.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure that the type inference correctly handles cases where the function parameters and return types involve templated types and ensure that these types are correctly resolved, even when they are nested or passed through multiple layers (like through higher-order functions or callbacks). The key areas to focus on for repair are:
1. Ensuring that `inferTemplateTypesFromParameters` can accurately infer types when templates are used in higher-order functions.
2. Verifying that the `TemplateTypeReplacer` correctly replaces templated types in the function signature without losing the context of their usage, especially when the templates are used in complex constructs.
3. Adding checks or logic to handle discrepancies in expected and actual types, particularly in generic functions where return types might not match the declared or inferred types, as seen in the test case where a string is returned instead of the class type.
