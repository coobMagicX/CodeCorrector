Intent: The test case `testSerialization3` is intended to verify that a `JFreeChart` object can be serialized and deserialized correctly without losing any functionality or data integrity. It particularly checks if the chart can still render an image after undergoing serialization and deserialization processes.

Repair strategy: The problem may lie in the serialization process where certain properties or configurations related to `JFreeChart` or its components (like axis settings, labels, or custom objects) aren't being handled correctly. To address this, ensure that all relevant classes and components implement the `Serializable` interface correctly and all non-serializable fields are appropriately managed with `transient` keyword or by implementing `writeObject` and `readObject` methods. Additionally, check for any custom objects or settings within the chart that may not be serializable by default and require custom handling for serialization.
