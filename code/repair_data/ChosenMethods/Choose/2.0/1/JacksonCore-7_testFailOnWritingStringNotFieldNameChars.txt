None of the candidate methods from the list are suitable to repair the source code based on the intent of the test. The 'reset' method does not seem to have any correlation with the validation of field names in the 'writeValue()' method. Therefore, new logic should be added to the 'writeValue()' method to handle invalid field names for objects. This logic is not currently present in the candidate methods list.
