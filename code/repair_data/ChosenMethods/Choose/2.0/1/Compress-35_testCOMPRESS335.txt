The context and the intent of the test repair do not seem to match. The given context is about a method that verifies the checksum of a TAR file header. However, the test repair intent is related to a method `getStreamFor` which is supposed to return a `TarArchiveInputStream` instance. Therefore, it's hard to choose a method from the candidates that would fit into the repair strategy of `getStreamFor` method based on the given context. The context seems to be missing the `getStreamFor` method implementation or related methods. Could you please provide the correct context?
