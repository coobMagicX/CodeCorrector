The context does not seem to provide any method from the candidate methods that would be useful for the repair strategy based on the test intent. The provided methods 'stripLeadingHyphens' and 'stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes' do not seem to address the issue related to handling of null values and option management within the `CommandLine` or `PosixParser` classes. Therefore, neither of these methods could be chosen for the repair strategy.
