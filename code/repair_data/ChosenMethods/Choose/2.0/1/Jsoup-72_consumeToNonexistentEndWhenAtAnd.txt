Based on the test-repair intent and the source code provided, it's hard to choose a method from the candidate methods as the source code doesn't seem to have a direct relation with the test-repair intent. The provided source code pertains to a cacheString method which appears to be unrelated to the consumeTo method referred in the test-repair intent. Therefore, additional context would be needed to choose an appropriate method for the repair strategy.
