The method that needs to be repaired based on the test intent and repair logic is `process` method of a `Token` object. To make sure that the parser correctly differentiates between data-containing tags and text-containing tags during the HTML parsing and DOM construction process, adjustments in the handling of text nodes and data nodes in the parsing logic might be needed. This may involve checking and possibly revising the parsing conditions or state transitions in the parser when encountering `<style>` and `<script>` tags to ensure they do not mistakenly contribute to the text output of the parser.
