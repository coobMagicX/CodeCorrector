Based on the test intent and repair logic, the method needed in the context is 'reset'.

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the method when writing a string that is not a field name.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this failed test case would involve analyzing the _testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldName() method to identify potential errors in the source code that could lead to the failure.

Source code:
public int reset() {
    _type = TYPE_OBJECT;
    _gotName = false;
    _index = -1;
    return STATUS_OK_AS_IS;
}
