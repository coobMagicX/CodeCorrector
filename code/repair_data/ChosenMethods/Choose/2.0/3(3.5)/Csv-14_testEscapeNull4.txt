Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method that needs to be modified is the `printAndEscape` method.

Desired format:
<idx>-`printAndEscape`

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the test case is to ensure that when the escape character is set to null, the CSVPrinter correctly handles the escaping of backslashes.

Repair strategy: Modify the code to handle the case when the escape character is null and correctly escape backslashes by doubling them.
