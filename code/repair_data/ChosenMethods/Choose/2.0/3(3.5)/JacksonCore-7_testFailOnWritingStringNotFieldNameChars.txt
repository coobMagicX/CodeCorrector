Based on the test intent and repair logic, the method that can aid in the repair is the `reset` method.

Desired format:
1-reset

Candidate methods that exist in the context: ['reset']

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the code when writing a string that does not consist of field name characters.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the case when the code encounters a string that does not consist of field name characters. This may involve adding a condition or modifying the existing conditions to handle this case appropriately.

Source code:
```java
public int writeValue() {
    // Most likely, object:
    if (_type == TYPE_OBJECT) {
        _gotName = false;
        ++_index;
        return STATUS_OK_AFTER_COLON;
    }

    // Ok, array?
    if (_type == TYPE_ARRAY) {
        int ix = _index;
        ++_index;
        return (ix < 0) ? STATUS_OK_AS_IS : STATUS_OK_AFTER_COMMA;
    }
    
    // Nope, root context
    // No commas within root context, but need space
    ++_index;
    return (_index == 0) ? STATUS_OK_AS_IS : STATUS_OK_AFTER_SPACE;
}
```

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the `reset` method. If it exists in the context, it needs to be evaluated for potential usage in the repair.
