To repair the source code based on the intent of the test, the appropriate method to modify in this context would be the `getHeaderMap()` method.

Desired format:
1-parse

Candidate methods that exist in the context: ['parse', 'close', 'getHeaderMap', 'iterator']

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the `getHeaderMap()` method returns `null` when the `CSVParser` object does not have a header map.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should be to modify the `getHeaderMap()` method to return `null` when the `headerMap` is not set.

Source code: 
1-getHeaderMap
