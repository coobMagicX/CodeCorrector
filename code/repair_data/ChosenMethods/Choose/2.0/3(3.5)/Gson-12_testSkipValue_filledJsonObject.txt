To repair the source code based on the intent of the test, the method that should be used is `popStack`.

The repaired code would look like this:

```java
@Override 
public void skipValue() throws IOException {
  if (peek() == JsonToken.NAME) {
    nextName();
    pathNames[stackSize - 2] = "null";
  } else {
    popStack();
    pathNames[stackSize - 1] = "null";
    pathIndices[stackSize - 1]++;
  }
}
```

Explanation: The `popStack` method is needed to correctly update the stack after skipping the value. In the original code, the `popStack` method was not called in the `else` block, which could lead to incorrect stack state. By adding the `popStack` method call, the stack is correctly updated and the repair is based on the test intent.
