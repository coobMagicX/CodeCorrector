To repair the source code based on the intent of the test, the method that needs to be modified is `unixTimeToZipLong`.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the implementation of the `unixTimeToZipLong` method to handle timestamps that are too big. This could be done by either converting the timestamp to a valid value within the range of a signed 32-bit integer or by updating the method to handle timestamps of any size.

Desired format:
1-<unixTimeToZipLong>
