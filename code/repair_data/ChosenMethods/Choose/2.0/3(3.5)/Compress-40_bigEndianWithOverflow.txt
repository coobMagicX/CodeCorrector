Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method that needs to be modified is the `readBits` method.

To repair the source code, the modification needs to be made in the `readBits` method.

Modified code:

```java
public long readBits(final int count) throws IOException {
    if (count < 0 || count > MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("count must not be negative or greater than " + MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE);
    }
    while (bitsCachedSize < count) {
        final long nextByte = in.read();
        if (nextByte < 0) {
            return nextByte;
        }
        if (byteOrder == ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN) {
            bitsCached |= (nextByte << bitsCachedSize);
        } else {
            bitsCached <<= 8;
            bitsCached |= nextByte;
        }
        bitsCachedSize += 8;
    }
    
    final long bitsOut;
    if (byteOrder == ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN) {
        bitsOut = (bitsCached >> (bitsCachedSize - count)) & MASKS[count];
        bitsCached >>>= count;
    } else {
        bitsOut = (bitsCached & MASKS[count]);
        bitsCached >>= count;
    }
    bitsCachedSize -= count;
    return bitsOut;
}
```

The modification is made in the calculation of `bitsOut` in the `readBits` method to correctly handle big-endian byte order. The left shift operator (`<<`) is replaced with the right shift operator (`>>`) and vice versa based on the byte order.
