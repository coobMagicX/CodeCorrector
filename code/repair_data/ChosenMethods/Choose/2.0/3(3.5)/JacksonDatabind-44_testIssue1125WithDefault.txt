Based on the test intent and repair logic, the method that needs to be added to the context is 'refine'.

Desired format:
1-refine

Candidate methods that exist in the context:['construct', '_narrow', 'refine', '_buildSuperClass', 'equals']

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the deserialization of a JSON string into an object of type Issue1125Wrapper is successful and that the values are correctly assigned.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the deserialization process for the Issue1125Wrapper class so that it correctly assigns the values from the JSON string.

Source code: 
protected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass)
{
    if (_class == subclass) {
        return this;
    }
    // Should we check that there is a sub-class relationship?
    // 15-Jan-2016, tatu: Almost yes, but there are some complications with
    //    placeholder values (`Void`, `NoClass`), so can not quite do yet.
    // TODO: fix in 2.8
        /*
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Class "+subclass.getName()+" not sub-type of "
                +_class.getName());
                */
        return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces,
                _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);
    // Otherwise, stitch together the hierarchy. First, super-class
    // if not found, try a super-interface
    // should not get here but...
