Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method needed in the context is:

15-discarNonBase64

The `discardNonBase64` method can be used to handle the case of an empty input stream correctly. By discarding any non-base64 characters, the method ensures that only valid base64 characters are encoded, which aligns with the repair strategy of handling the empty input stream appropriately.
