Based on the test intent and repair logic, the method that needs to be added in the context is 'readLine'. 

The repaired code would look like this:

public String readLine() throws IOException {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    int current;
    while ((current = read()) != -1 && current != '\n') {
        sb.append((char) current);
    }
    if (current == '\n') {
        lineCounter++;
    }
    lastChar = current;
    return sb.toString();
}
