Based on the provided test intent and repair strategy, the method that might aid in the repair is 'merge'. 

Repaired code:
protected final boolean merge(Annotation ann) {
    if (_annotations == null) {
        _annotations = new HashMap<Class<? extends Annotation>,Annotation>();
    }
    Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType(), ann);
    return (previous != null) && previous.equals(ann);
}
