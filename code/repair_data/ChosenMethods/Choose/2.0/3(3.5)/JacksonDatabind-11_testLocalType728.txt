Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method that could aid in the repair is `_constructType`.

Revised source code:

```
protected JavaType _fromVariable(TypeVariable<?> type, TypeBindings context) {
    final String name = type.getName();
    if (context == null) {
        return _unknownType();
    } else {
        JavaType actualType = context.findType(name);
        if (actualType != null) {
            return actualType;
        }
    }

    Type[] bounds = type.getBounds();

    context._addPlaceholder(name);
    return _constructType(bounds[0], context);
}
```

Revised code explanation:

The `_constructType` method is called to construct the JavaType object for the first bound of the type variable. This ensures that the correct JavaType object is created and returned based on the given type variable.
