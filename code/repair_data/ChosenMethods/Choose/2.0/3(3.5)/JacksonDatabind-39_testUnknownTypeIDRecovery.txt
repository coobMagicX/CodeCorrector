To repair the source code based on the intent of the test, the method 'deserializeWithType' should be used.

Desired format:
1-deserializeWithType

Candidate methods that exist in the context:['deserialize', 'deserializeWithType']

Test-Repair intent:
Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of deserialization when encountering unknown subtypes. The test cases aim to ensure that the deserialization process handles unknown subtypes correctly and recovers from errors.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code should be to properly handle unknown subtypes during deserialization. This can be achieved by implementing logic to handle unknown subtypes and recover from errors gracefully.

Source code: 
public Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException
{
    // 29-Jan-2016, tatu: Simple skipping for all other tokens, but FIELD_NAME bit
    //    special unfortunately
    p.skipChildren();
    return null;
}
