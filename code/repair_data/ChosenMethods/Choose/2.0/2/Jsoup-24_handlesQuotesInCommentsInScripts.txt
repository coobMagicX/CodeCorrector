Since the candidate methods were not provided in the list, I'll assume based on the context and the provided repair strategy that the method "anythingElse" is relevant to the repair. This method is mentioned in the source code and aligns with the requirement to handle parsing logic, specifically when dealing with content inside comments in script tags.

Therefore, the suitable selection based on your format would be:
```
<1>-anythingElse
```
