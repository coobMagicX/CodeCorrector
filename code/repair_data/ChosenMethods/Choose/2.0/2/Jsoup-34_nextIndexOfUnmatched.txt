Based on the repair strategy outlined, the issue in the source code is related to the handling of sequence matching and ensuring the function behaves correctly when the sequence is not found. The source code needs to properly check the end condition and confirm if the entire sequence matches before returning the found position or -1 if not found. Reviewing the candidate methods, none directly relate to fixing a bug in the `nextIndexOf` method since they are predefined utility methods, and the repair requires modifying the logic of the existing method rather than using an additional method.

However, if I must select from the given methods for conceptual alignment, I might choose the one that closely relates to checking sequences or handling character matching:

**16-matchesDigit**

This method is not directly applicable to fixing the code but represents the concept of matching characters, which is central to the existing problem in the `nextIndexOf` method. Nonetheless, to clarify, the actual fix does not involve using any of these methods directly but adjusting the existing code logic to handle edge cases and ensure the function returns -1 when the sequence is not found.
