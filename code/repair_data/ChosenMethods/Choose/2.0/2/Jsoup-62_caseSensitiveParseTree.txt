It appears that the provided source code snippet and the repair intent focus on the handling of HTML tag names in a case-sensitive manner. The test "caseSensitiveParseTree" intends to ensure that the HTML parser preserves the original case of HTML tags. However, the function `anyOtherEndTag` in the source code uses `normalName()`, which likely normalizes tag names to a specific case (commonly lowercase), thereby potentially altering the original case of tags.

Since there are no candidate methods provided in the list to choose from, we cannot select a specific method as requested. However, to address the issue based on the test and repair intent, the method in question (`anyOtherEndTag`) must be modified to handle tag names in a case-preserving way. This would typically involve:

1. Removing or modifying the `normalName()` method so that it does not normalize the name or creating an alternative that preserves the case.
2. Ensuring that all comparisons and manipulations of tag names within `anyOtherEndTag` and related methods respect the original casing as per the parser settings.

Thus, without specific candidate methods to select from, the action would be to revise the `anyOtherEndTag` method to correctly implement case-sensitive handling of tag names directly in the source code provided.
