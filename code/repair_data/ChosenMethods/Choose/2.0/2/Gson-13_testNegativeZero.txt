Based on the context provided, the repair strategy involves modifying the `peekNumber()` method to handle the specific case of recognizing and correctly parsing the string "-0" from a JSON array. The intent of the test case `testNegativeZero()` is to ensure that this value is not mistakenly processed as "0" or ignored as an invalid numeric input.

Given the details of the repair strategy, particularly the focus on how numerical values, including "-0", are processed within the `peekNumber()` method, the appropriate response from the candidate methods list that matches this context is:

**peekNumber**

Therefore, the correct answer in the desired format is:
**peekNumber**
