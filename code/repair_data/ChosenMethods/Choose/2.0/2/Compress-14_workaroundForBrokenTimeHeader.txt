Given the detailed description of the test-repair intent and the specific failure in handling tar header fields, it's clear that the issue lies within the parsing of octal values which are crucial for reading metadata like file sizes and modification times from the TAR entries.

Considering the provided code snippet for `parseOctal`, the method is already designed to parse octal values from a buffer. However, the test failure suggests that it might not handle non-standard or corrupted tar header formats (specifically time fields) very well. The failure at `tae = in.getNextTarEntry();` suggests that an improvement in the robustness of the octal parsing logic is required.

From the candidate methods listed:
- `parseOctalOrBinary`
- `exceptionMessage`
- `formatUnsignedOctalString`
- `formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes`

The method that appears most relevant to directly address the issue in the parsing logic as described would be `parseOctalOrBinary`. This method name suggests that it could potentially handle more complex scenarios involving octal or binary data, which might include better error handling or fallback mechanisms for parsing. This assumption is based on the method's name, which implies additional functionality over the basic `parseOctal` method.

Therefore, the correct choice based on the context would be:
`1-parseOctalOrBinary`
