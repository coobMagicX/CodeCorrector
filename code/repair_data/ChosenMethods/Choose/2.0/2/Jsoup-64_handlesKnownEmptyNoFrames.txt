It seems there might be a misunderstanding, as the candidate methods list provided is empty: "Candidate methods that exist in the context:[]". This prevents me from selecting a method directly from your provided list. However, based on the provided intent and repair strategy, I can suggest a method that should exist or be created within the context to handle the specified test-repair intent.

To address the test intent and repair strategy adequately, a method that modifies or extends the behavior of the HTML parser to handle self-closing tags appropriately might be required. Hereâ€™s a hypothetical method that could be created or modified:

- `<idx>-handleSelfClosingTags`

This method would be responsible for ensuring that self-closing tags like `<noframes />` are expanded into `<noframes></noframes>`, maintaining the rest of the document structure intact. It might involve adjustments in the parsing logic to treat certain self-closing tags as needing explicit open and close tags in the output HTML.

Since the source code snippet provided deals with raw text handling and state transitions in a parsing context, a new or modified method would likely need to be integrated within these parsing states or transitions to correctly handle the self-closing tags according to HTML5 standards. However, without the actual list of candidate methods, this is a speculative solution based on the described intent and strategy. Please provide the list of candidate methods or more context if you need a more accurate selection.
