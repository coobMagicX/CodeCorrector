Based on the given intent and repair strategy for the test case `consumeToNonexistentEndWhenAtEnd`, and the specific functionalities of the available methods, the appropriate method to focus on for repairing the source code of the `CharacterReader` class is:

**`isEmpty`**

This method would be useful for checking if the buffer is empty at the current position or after attempting to consume characters until a specified character that does not exist. Ensuring that `consumeTo(char c)` uses `isEmpty` correctly could help in handling cases where the buffer reaches its end without finding the specified character, thus adhering to the repair strategy that involves properly managing the buffer's end state and correctly returning an empty string as expected by the test case.

Desired format selection:
**<3-isEmpty>**
