It appears that there might be a misunderstanding or an error, as the candidate methods that exist in the context are not listed in your message. To properly select a method that should be modified or used to implement the repair strategy, I would need the list of candidate methods available.

If you can provide the list of candidate methods, I can help you choose the appropriate one based on the repair strategy required to handle self-closing `<style>` tags by converting them into open and close tag pairs in the HTML output. This involves ensuring that during the parsing, specific rules are applied to these tags, likely modifying how the `handleRawtext` function or associated methods manage these situations.

Please provide the list of candidate methods, or clarify if you need help with another type of input or assistance.
