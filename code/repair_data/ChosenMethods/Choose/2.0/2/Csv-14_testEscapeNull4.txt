Based on the provided test-repair intent and source code analysis, the appropriate method to choose from the candidate list is:

**Method to be repaired:**
`printAndQuote`

This method is directly involved in handling the quoting and escaping logic as described in the repair strategy. The repair should ensure that if the escape character is null, literal characters such as backslashes are not escaped but are printed as-is. The current implementation does not explicitly handle the scenario where the escape character is null, leading to potential incorrect handling of escape sequences. 

To implement the repair, adjustments should be made within the `printAndQuote` method to bypass the escaping logic when the escape character is null, ensuring characters are treated as literals and output exactly as received.
