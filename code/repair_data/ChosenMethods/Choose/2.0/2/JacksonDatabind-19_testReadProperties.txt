Based on the test-repair intent outlined, the source code's handling of type conversion needs modification to ensure that non-string JSON values are converted properly into string representations within the `Properties` object. The issue appears to be with the mapping logic which might not be properly handling the conversion of all types to strings.

Given that the `Properties` class in Java is essentially a special type of map where both keys and values are strings, the type parameters for the map should explicitly be `String.class` for both keys and values. This ensures that all entries, regardless of their original types in the JSON, are converted to strings.

The method `_mapType` in the source code should be modified to always return a `MapType` with `String.class` for both key and value type parameters when dealing with a `Properties` class. This would override the normal type parameter discovery which might be incorrectly inferring types from the JSON data.

Therefore, the suitable method to amend would be `_mapType` to ensure it constructs the `MapType` with both key and value types set as `String.class`, especially for `Properties` objects.

Desired format response:
<idx>-<method name>

Given this, the answer would be:
_21-constructMapType
