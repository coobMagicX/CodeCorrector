Based on the provided context and the test-repair intent, the method to be used for the repair should accurately detect when a function or a `do` statement is directly inside a conditional statement without an enclosing block. The existing method `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` is the primary candidate for modification to incorporate this additional logic.

However, within the given method options, none directly suggest a method that encapsulates this specific enhancement. The closest existing method that could be adapted to fit this purpose is `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo`, as it currently checks if a node is a function or a `do` statement, but it does not consider its placement within control structures like `if` statements.

Therefore, the most appropriate selection from the candidate list is:

**5-isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo**

This selection indicates that the `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` method should be modified to include logic that checks for the specific scenario of functions or `do` statements within conditionals without an enclosing block. This modification aligns with the test-repair intent described.
