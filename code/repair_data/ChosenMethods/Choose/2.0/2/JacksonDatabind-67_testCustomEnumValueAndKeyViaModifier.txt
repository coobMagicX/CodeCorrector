Given the intent of the test and the repair strategy that involves modifying the custom `KeyDeserializer` to handle case insensitivity correctly during enum key deserialization, the method that needs to be focused on is the one where this modification can be applied effectively.

The source code shows that the custom `KeyDeserializer` may be modified in the final part of the method `createKeyDeserializer`, especially through the use of deserializer modifiers. The method `modifyKeyDeserializer` from the `BeanDeserializerModifier` class is used to modify the `KeyDeserializer`. This is the point at which the handling of key case sensitivity should be addressed.

According to the candidate methods list, we should look for a method that directly allows modifying the `KeyDeserializer` based on the deserializer modifiers:

- `modifyKeyDeserializer`

Thus, the appropriate method from the list that we need to focus on for repairing the source code based on the test intent and described repair logic is:

`<idx>-modifyKeyDeserializer`

However, since the test description and source code context do not provide a direct index for each method in the candidate list, I will provide the method name without an index:

`modifyKeyDeserializer`
