Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method that needs to be added to the context is:

15-_parse

The _parse method can be used to handle the deserialization of a JSON object into a Map with CharSequence keys. By adding a check for CharSequence.class in the if-else ladder and calling the _parse method for the CharSequence key, the source code can be repaired to handle the desired deserialization.
