Based on the test intent and repair strategy, the method that needs to be added in the context is 'hasCustomMapValueDeserializer'. 

Modified source code:
```
public boolean isCachable() {
    /* As per [databind#735], existence of value or key deserializer (only passed
     * if annotated to use non-standard one) should also prevent caching.
     */
    return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)
            && (_ignorableProperties == null)
            && !hasCustomMapValueDeserializer();
}
```
