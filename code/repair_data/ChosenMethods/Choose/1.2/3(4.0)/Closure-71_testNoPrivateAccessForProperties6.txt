Based on the intent and fix strategy for the test repair, here are the appropriate context choices:

1-Class_list: `CheckAccessControls`
2-Constructor_list: `CheckAccessControls`
3-Methods_list: `checkPropertyVisibility`

These choices reflect the involvement in checking and managing the visibility of properties in JavaScript objects, which aligns with the intent of the source code and the necessary modifications for the fix strategy.
