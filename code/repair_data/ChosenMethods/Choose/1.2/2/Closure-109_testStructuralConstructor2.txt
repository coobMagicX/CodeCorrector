Based on the information provided, it seems like the issue lies in correctly determining if the parsed type is a constructor or not. To address this, you can utilize the `parseContextTypeExpression` method to parse a context type expression from a JsDocToken and then use the `parseTypeName` method to handle the parsing logic for determining if it represents a constructor.

Therefore, the method you would choose from the candidate methods to repair the source code based on the intent of the test is:

1-parseTypeName
