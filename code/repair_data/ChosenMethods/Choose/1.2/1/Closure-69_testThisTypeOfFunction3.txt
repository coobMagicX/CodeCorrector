Based on the analysis provided, the `visitCall` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle and enforce the expected "this" type for the function calls, especially in scenarios involving prototype chains and constructor functions like in the failed test case.

To address the issue, you need to add the following method implementation:

1-`visitCall`

Please add the necessary logic within the `visitCall` method to enforce the specific "this" type requirement for function calls, especially when accessed through prototype chains like `(new F()).bar`.

Make sure to review and adjust the logic related to handling and validating the "this" type for function calls in the provided JavaScript code snippet to ensure the expectations of the test case are met.
