To address the specific failure in the `testDoubleInlining2` test case, you can focus on the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method. The method may not be handling the `call` function correctly, leading to a false negative result. To improve this, you can review the logic in the method, particularly focusing on how it handles function calls and their arguments, as well as how it checks for side effects and argument evaluation.

For this specific situation, you should consider the following approach:

1- Review the processing of functions called via `call` and `apply` to ensure correct handling.
2- Check the identification of arguments and parameters in the code snippet for accurate evaluation.
3- Verify the logic for potential side effects and argument evaluation to ensure correct inlining feasibility evaluation.

Consider adding additional test cases covering various call scenarios and argument usages to validate and enhance the correctness of the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method.
