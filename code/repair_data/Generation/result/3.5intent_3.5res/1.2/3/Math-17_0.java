// Assuming the issue is related to the testMultiply method in the DfpTest class
// You can try verifying the implementation of testMultiply method in the DfpTest class
// Ensure that the expected and actual results are being compared correctly within the testMultiply method
// Without the exact implementation of testMultiply method, it's challenging to provide a precise fix within the given constraints
// You may need to review the testMultiply method in the DfpTest class for potential issues causing the failure

// If you identify specific issues in the testMultiply method, you can make adjustments accordingly within the DfpTest class
// However, for fixing the issue in the provided source code section, more information or the actual implementation of testMultiply is required
