Intent: The test case `testSerialization4` intends to verify the serialization and deserialization functionality of a `JFreeChart` object, specifically testing whether a chart that includes a time series dataset can be serialized and then deserialized back to an equivalent object, maintaining all properties and functionalities.

Repair strategy: To address the failure in this test case, investigate the serialization compatibility of all components involved in the `JFreeChart` object, particularly focusing on the custom classes such as `XYAnnotation`, `XYDataset`, or any other user-defined class that may not be serializing properly. Ensure that all custom classes involved in the chart object implement the `Serializable` interface correctly and that transitive dependencies (if any) are also serializable. Additionally, review any static or transient fields that might be causing issues during serialization or after deserialization. If custom serialization methods (`writeObject` and `readObject`) are used, ensure they handle all necessary fields adequately.
