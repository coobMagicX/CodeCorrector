Intent: The test case `testSingletonGetter1()` is intended to verify that the `canInline` method correctly handles cases involving singleton getter methods, specifically ensuring that singleton getters are not inlined inappropriately which could disrupt the intended singleton behavior and class structure.

Repair strategy: Modify the `canInline` method to include additional checks or enhance the existing conditions for handling cases involving singleton getter methods. Specifically, it should identify and prevent the inlining of getter methods that are designed to manage singleton instance creation and management. The logic should ensure that such methods, when detected, result in `canInline` returning `false`, thereby preserving the singleton pattern integrity.
