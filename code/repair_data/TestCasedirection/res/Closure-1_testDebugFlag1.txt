Intent: The intent of the test case `testDebugFlag1` is to verify that the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method does not remove unreferenced function arguments when the compilation level is set to simple optimizations, even if the debug flag is set to false. This test ensures that the function's definition remains unchanged in the context of simple optimizations, preserving all supplied arguments irrespective of their usage within the function.

Repair strategy: The current implementation appears to remove function arguments that are not referenced, disregarding the specified compilation level (as per the test's intent suggesting the behavior for "SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS"). The code needs to be adjusted to respect the compilation level settings, specifically avoiding the removal of unreferenced arguments when the compilation level is set to simple optimizations. This could involve adding a check for the compilation level setting before proceeding with the removal logic in the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method.
