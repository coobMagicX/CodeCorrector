Intent:
The test case `testInlineIfParametersModified8` aims to verify if the method `canInlineReferenceDirectly` correctly determines whether a function can be inlined when the function modifies a property of an object passed as a parameter. The test checks if the function call `f(o)` where `f` modifies the property `x` of its object parameter `a` can be inlined to directly perform the modification on `o.x`.

Repair strategy:
The source code should ensure that modifications to object properties within the function do not automatically prevent inlining. Currently, the code might be overly restrictive by disallowing inlining if any parameter is used to modify state, which includes object properties. The repair should adjust the checks within `canInlineReferenceDirectly` to differentiate between mutable state changes that should prevent inlining (like changing the object itself) and those that should not (like changing an object's properties). This could involve refining the condition that checks if arguments affect mutable state or adapting how `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` is applied to object properties.
