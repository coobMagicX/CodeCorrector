Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1101b` is to verify whether the function `canInlineReferenceDirectly` correctly identifies that a function call `foo(x.prop)` should not be inlined when the function `foo` has a mutable state change as part of its return expression `(x.prop = 2),a;`. This is crucial for ensuring that inlining does not occur when side effects from the function could alter the behavior of the program.

Repair strategy: Modify the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` method to handle cases where the function to be inlined contains expressions that modify mutable state, particularly in the return statement. The repair should likely involve enhancing the check within the while loop that processes each argument and function parameter. This would involve refining the condition that checks if an argument may affect mutable state (`NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState`) or adding additional checks to recognize side effects within the function's body itself, not just its parameters. Specifically, ensure that side effects in the function's return expression are also considered when determining the inlinability of a function call.
