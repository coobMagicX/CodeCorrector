Intent: The test case `testGetprop4` is designed to check the behavior of the `visitGetProp` function when trying to access a property of a `null` value. The test ensures that the function correctly handles property access on null values by reporting an error that properties cannot be accessed on expressions evaluated to null.

Repair strategy: Adjust the code in the `visitGetProp` method to properly handle cases where the object node (`objNode`) is `null`. This involves enhancing the condition checks to explicitly handle null and possibly undefined values, ensuring that such cases are caught early and reported as errors before attempting further property access or type evaluations that assume a non-null value. Consider adding a specific condition to check if `objNode` is null right after retrieving its type and before any further processing.
