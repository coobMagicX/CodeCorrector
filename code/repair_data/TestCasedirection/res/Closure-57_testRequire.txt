Intent: The purpose of the failing test case is to ensure that the method `extractClassNameIfGoog` does not interpret calls where the argument to `goog.require` is not a string literal (e.g., `goog.require(foo)`) as valid class name extractions.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to add a check ensuring that the argument to `goog.require` is a string literal before allowing the extraction of the class name. This involves analyzing the node type or content to differentiate between string literals and other expressions or identifiers.
