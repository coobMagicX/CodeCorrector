Intent: The test case 'testAxisMargins' intends to verify that margins set on the domain axis of an XYPlot correctly affect the range of the domain axis, expanding the overall range length as expected when margins are applied.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the method `getDataRange(ValueAxis axis)` properly accounts for the axis margins when calculating the range. This might involve adjusting the code to incorporate the effect of `setLowerMargin` and `setUpperMargin` on the resultant range. Specifically, after obtaining the range from datasets and annotations, apply the margin settings of the axis to expand the range accordingly. This implementation should consider the margin percentages to dynamically adjust the range based on the initial calculated values.
