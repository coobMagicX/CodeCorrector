Intent: The purpose of the source code is to calculate the range of data in a given dataset, identifying whether the axis in question is a domain or range axis. This is done by mapping the datasets to the appropriate axis, combining the range found for each dataset, and considering any associated annotations that should be included in the data bounds.

Fix Strategy: The failed test case suggests that the issue lies within the creation of the scatterplot chart. The error might be due to incorrect parameters passed to the `ChartFactory.createScatterPlot()` method or the method itself could be flawed. Check the parameters being passed in the failing line. If they are correct, then the issue might be in the `createScatterPlot()` method itself. If the issue is in the `createScatterPlot()` method, inspect the method's implementation and ensure it correctly handles the parameters and creates a scatterplot correctly. If the issue lies in the parameters, correct them to ensure they adhere to the expected format and data types.
