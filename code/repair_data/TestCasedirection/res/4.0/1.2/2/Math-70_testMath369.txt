Intent: The purpose of the source code is to solve a given univariate real function within a given range of min and max, using a certain initial value.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be in the 'solve' method. It is ignoring the 'initial' parameter and only using 'min' and 'max'. The 'solve' method should incorporate the 'initial' parameter into its logic if it is a part of necessary computations. The 'initial' parameter could be a starting point for an iterative method to find a root of the function, for example. The fix strategy would be to modify the solve method to take into account the 'initial' parameter.
