Intent: The intent of this code is to determine whether a function call can be inlined directly or not. It is checking if a function call node replacement is possible, if the function has side effects, if the function is called via 'call' or 'apply', if the arguments of the function are evaluated more than once and if they have side effects. Based on these checks, it then returns a CanInlineResult which can either be YES or NO.

Fix strategy: The test failed because the logic in the source code did not handle the specific use case of the test. The root cause appears to be the inability of the code to handle the inline function `getDomServices_` and `getOwnerWin_`. The failure appears to be related to the handling of nested function calls and their side effects. 

One possible solution would be to refine the checks related to side effects and mutable arguments. Ensure that the code is able to correctly identify and handle these side effects, especially when nested function calls are involved. 

Additionally, the code should also be designed to handle situations where the call node is not directly a name, specifically when the call involves 'call' and 'apply'. The handling of these cases seems to be tricky and might be causing the test to fail.

The source code should be updated to incorporate these changes and then the test case should be re-run to verify if the issue has been resolved.
