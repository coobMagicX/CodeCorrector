Intent: The intent of the source code is to create a copy of a part of the TimeSeries data from the start index to the end index. The purpose of the failed test case is to check if the new TimeSeries, which is a copy of a portion of the original TimeSeries, has the correct minimum and maximum values.

Fix strategy: From the failed test case, it can be inferred that the method getMaxY() is not returning the expected maximum value for the copied TimeSeries. This could be due to the add method not correctly updating the maximum value or the getMaxY() method not correctly retrieving the maximum value. Debug these methods to find the root cause, and then correct the faulty logic or calculations.
