Intent: The purpose is to parse a type expression from a JavaScript document token into a node structure. The test case is to verify the parsing function by testing the parsing of a structural constructor. 

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be happening at the line where the `testParseType` function is called. The failure might be due to the wrong token being passed into the function or the function not handling the input correctly. Firstly, check if the correct and expected token is being passed into the function. If the token is correct, then the issue might be with the `parseTypeName` function. It may not be correctly parsing the specific type in the test case. Debug the `parseTypeName` function with the failing test case as input to identify the root cause. Based on the root cause, the fix could include handling additional cases in the function or correcting the existing parsing logic.
