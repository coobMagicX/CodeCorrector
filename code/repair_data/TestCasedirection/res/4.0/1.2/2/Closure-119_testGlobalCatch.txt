Intent: The purpose of the source code is to collect specific data about JavaScript (JS) modules. It does this by examining each node in the syntax tree of the JS code and determining its type (e.g., function, variable, object literal, etc.), whether it's a global name, and whether it's a get or set operation. Depending on these factors, the code then calls different handler functions.

Fix Strategy: The error seems to be happening in the test case, not in the source code itself. The `testSame()` method is likely expecting two arguments: the input code and the expected output. However, in the test case provided, only one argument is given. Therefore, the test case should be updated to include the expected output. The expected output should be a string of JS code that is the expected result of running the input code through the `collect()` method. 

Please note that the above fix strategy is based on the assumption that the `testSame()` method requires two arguments. If the issue lies somewhere else, you would need to provide more details about the `testSame()` method and the error message received when the test case fails.
