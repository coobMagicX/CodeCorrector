Intent: The intent of the source code is to visit a node and identify its type in a JavaScript program using a switch case structure. It checks various tokens, ensures that they are typed correctly based on certain conditions and performs type checking on some operations such as equality, comparison, assignment, etc. It also handles specific scenarios like function calls, object literals, and array literals. The test case is designed to evaluate the functionality of getting the percentage of the typed variable. It is expected to return 100%, but it fails.

Fix strategy: The failure could be because of the `getTypedPercent` function not returning the correct percentage of the typed variable. This function should be reviewed and debugged. Check if all types are correctly identified and the percentage calculation is correct. Also, verify that the enum type is correctly handled and identified as typed. If it's not the case, proper implementation for handling enum type should be added.
