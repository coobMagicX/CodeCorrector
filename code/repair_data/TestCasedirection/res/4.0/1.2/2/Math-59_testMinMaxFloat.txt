Intent: The purpose of the source code is to return the maximum of two float numbers. The method checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, if so it returns `b`, otherwise it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is not a number (NaN), if so it returns NaN, otherwise it returns `b`. 

The purpose of the test case is to check the correctness of the "max" function with various pairs of float numbers including positive, negative, zero, NaN, and infinity.

Fix strategy: The bug in the source code is that it incorrectly returns `b` when `a` is greater than `b`. Instead, it should return `a`. The source code should be updated to:
```java
public static float max(final float a, final float b) {
    return (a <= b) ? b : (Float.isNaN(a + b) ? Float.NaN : a);
}
```
The failed test case is due to this mistake. After updating the source code, the test case should pass.
