Intent: The purpose of the source code is to solve an ordinary differential equation using the Dormand-Prince 853 method. The method is an adaptive step size control method that adjusts the step size to minimize the error of the solution. The objective of the test case is to verify the integrator's ability to handle large initial step sizes.

Fix Strategy: The failure seems to occur at the integration step. This could be due to the large initial step size. The error handling mechanism for the step size control might not be properly implemented, resulting in the inability to adjust the step size when the error is too large. The fix strategy would be to improve the error handling mechanism in the step size control. Recheck the algorithm used for adapting the step size and ensure it is implemented correctly. It may also be useful to add a condition to check if the step size is too large and adjust it accordingly before proceeding with the integration.
