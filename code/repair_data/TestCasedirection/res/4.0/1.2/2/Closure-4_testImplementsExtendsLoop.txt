Intent: The purpose of this source code is to check and resolve named types in JavaScript via two mechanisms, either by registry or by properties. It also checks for implicit prototype cycles and handles them accordingly. The failed test case is designed to test the functionality where the code handles cyclic inheritance in JavaScript classes.

Fix strategy: The error seems to occur during the testing process rather than the source code itself. It's likely that the test case is not properly formatted or the expected output is incorrect. Verify the string concatenation in testClosureTypesMultipleWarnings() and ensure the expected warning message is accurate. If the error persists, debug the test case step by step to identify the error's source. Also, ensure that the handling of inheritance cycles in the source code is done correctly.
