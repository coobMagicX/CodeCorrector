Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation. The method checks if the invocation method is a variable argument method. If it is, it currently throws an UnsupportedOperationException. If it's not, it iterates through the matchers, checks if the matcher is of type 'CapturesArguments' and then captures the argument from the invocation at the specific position. The code also has a provision to handle variable arguments if the matcher is a 'VarargMatcher'.

The failed test case is trying to test a scenario where an object returning method is stubbed with different arguments and return values. It checks if the stubbing is working as expected.

Fix strategy: The UnsupportedOperationException in the source code indicates that the code is not yet implemented for variable argument methods. The failed test case is likely due to this unimplemented feature. So, the fix strategy would be to implement the variable arguments capturing logic in the code.

It is also possible that the stubbing is not working as expected due to wrong argument matching. The 'isA(Integer.class)' matcher will match any Integer object, not just the specific value '200'. This might be the cause of the test failure. The fix would be to ensure correct argument matchers are used during stubbing.

Also, the 'invocation.getRawArguments().length > position' check seems to be extraneous and could possibly cause issues with the argument capturing. If the size of the argument list is less than the current position, the code will not work as expected. This check could be removed and the 'isVariableArgument' method could handle this scenario.
