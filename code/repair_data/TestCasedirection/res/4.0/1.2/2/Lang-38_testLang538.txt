Intent: The intent and purpose of the source code is to format a given Calendar object into a StringBuffer using specific rules and timezone. If a timezone is forced, it clones the calendar and sets its timezone to the forced timezone before applying the rules.

The purpose of the test case is to check the correct functioning of the format method of the FastDateFormat class. It aims to validate that the method correctly formats the date and time information, taking into consideration the specific timezone ("GMT").

Fix strategy: The test case failure on the line `assertEquals("dateTime", dateTime, format.format(cal));` indicates that the formatted date/time string doesn't match the expected output. This could be due to timezone discrepancies between the calendar and the FastDateFormat instance. 

To fix this, ensure that the timezone used to create the GregorianCalendar object and the FastDateFormat instance are the same. Here, the GregorianCalendar object is using "GMT-8" timezone, whereas the FastDateFormat instance is using "GMT". Correcting this discrepancy to use the same timezone should resolve the issue.
