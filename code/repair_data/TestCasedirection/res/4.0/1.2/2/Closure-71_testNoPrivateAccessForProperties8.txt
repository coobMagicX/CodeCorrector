Intent: The purpose of this code is to check the visibility of a property in JavaScript objects and ensure that private properties are not accessed or overridden improperly. It checks the property's visibility and reports errors when there are violations, such as trying to override a private property from a different input file, or accessing a private property from a different class or outside the file. 

Fix strategy: The failing test case indicates that an error was expected (PRIVATE_OVERRIDE), but none was thrown. This suggests that the property visibility check might not be working as expected for private properties. The fix would involve ensuring that the code correctly identifies and reports when a private property is being overridden. This might involve a careful review and debugging of the conditions under which the PRIVATE_OVERRIDE error is thrown. For instance, check if the condition `if (visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE && !sameInput)` is being met as expected. Also, ensure that the visibility of the overriding property is correctly identified and compared with the original one.
