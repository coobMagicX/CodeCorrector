Intent: The purpose of the source code is to initialize a ValueMarker object with specific attributes: value, paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, and alpha. The failed test case is checking whether these attributes are correctly set and retrievable.

Fix strategy: The error seems to be in the `super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);` line in the source code. As per the test case, the third argument should be `outlinePaint` and the fourth should be `outlineStroke` instead of repeating `paint` and `stroke`. Therefore, the corrected line should be `super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);`. This will ensure that the `getOutlinePaint()` method returns the correct color which is the cause of the failed test case.
