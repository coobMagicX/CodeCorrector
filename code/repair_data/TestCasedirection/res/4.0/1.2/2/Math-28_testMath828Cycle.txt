Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to find out the pivot row in the Simplex Tableau. The main goal of this function is to solve a linear optimization problem using the Simplex algorithm. It gets the pivot row from the Simplex Tableau and performs the minimum ratio test to find the optimal solution for the problem. 

The failed test case "testMath828Cycle" is intended to test the optimization of the function for the "MINIMIZE" goal type with certain constraints. It is trying to minimize the function under these constraints and expects the optimum solution to be '1.0d'. However, the test fails at the point where it tries to get the solution from the SimplexSolver's optimize function, implying that the function is not returning the expected result.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be with the SimplexSolver's optimize function. The first step would be to debug the optimize function in the SimplexSolver class to check if it is working as expected. If the function is working correctly, the next step would be to check the constraints and the goal type passed to it. 

There may be a problem with the constraints or the goal type that is causing the function to not return the expected result. The constraints or the goal type may need to be adjusted to ensure that the function returns the correct result. Another possible cause could be the precision of the floating-point operations, which may need to be increased to get a more accurate result. 

In case none of these fixes work, it may be necessary to revisit the implementation of the SimplexSolver's optimize function to ensure it correctly implements the Simplex algorithm. This could involve checking the pivot selection and the minimum ratio test, as well as the handling of degenerate cases.
