Intent: The purpose of the source code is to convert an array of objects into an array of their respective Class types. The method `toClass()` takes an array of Objects as an argument and returns an array of Classes that correspond to the classes of the objects. It also handles null and empty inputs, returning null and an empty Class array respectively.

The failing test case `testToClass_object()` is testing this method with various inputs, including null, an empty array, and arrays of various Objects. The specific line that failed is checking if the method can handle an array that includes null as one of its elements.

Fix strategy: The problem is that the source code does not account for null elements within the input array. When it encounters a null element, it tries to call `getClass()` on it, which results in a NullPointerException. A fix for this issue would be to add a null check within the for loop in the `toClass()` method. If the element is null, the corresponding Class in the `classes` array should also be set to null. Here is the adjusted code:

```
public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object[] array) {
    if (array == null) {
        return null;
    } else if (array.length == 0) {
        return ArrayUtils.EMPTY_CLASS_ARRAY;
    }
    Class<?>[] classes = new Class[array.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if(array[i] == null) {
            classes[i] = null;
        } else {
            classes[i] = array[i].getClass();
        }
    }
    return classes;
}
```
