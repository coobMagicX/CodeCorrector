Intent: The test case `testParseInto_monthOnly` aims to parse a single month digit string ("5") into a MutableDateTime object initially set to a specific date, and then verify if the month is correctly set to May (5th month) while keeping other components of the date and time unchanged.

Repair strategy: The problem appears to be related to improper handling or updating of the MutableDateTime object during parsing, especially when dealing with time zones. The source code might not be correctly maintaining the original context of the DateTime object after parsing the month. Ensure the handling of time zone conversions and adjustments does not alter unexpected parts of the date-time object. Verify the logic around time zone adjustments and consider modifying the parsing logic to preserve other date-time components (like day, year, and time) correctly when only a single field (month in this case) is being updated.
