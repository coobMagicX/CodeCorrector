Intent: The intent of the test case `testScoping12` is to validate the scoping and type consistency within nested functions. It checks whether the nested function `h` correctly identifies the type of `f.bar` as `number` and whether this type is consistent with the declared return type `string` of `h`.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the type checking mechanism in the source code to ensure that it can correctly identify and handle inconsistencies between declared return types and actual return types in nested functions. The solution could also include better scoping rules to manage how variables and their types from outer functions are accessed and inferred in inner functions. Specifically, the code should enforce type consistency checks between the return expression in function `h` and its JSDoc-annotated return type. This could involve refining how types are extracted and compared from JSDoc comments and how they are used during the function's return type validation.
