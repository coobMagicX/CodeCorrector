Intent: The test case `testMinusMonths_int_fromLeap` is intended to verify that subtracting a month from a `MonthDay` object representing February 29 in a leap year correctly results in January 29 of the same year. This tests the date arithmetic across a leap day scenario which does not exist in all years.

Repair strategy: The error in the source code likely comes from mishandling the leap year scenario when subtracting months. Review and possibly adjust the date arithmetic logic in the `add` method, particularly ensuring that the subtraction of months from a date like February 29 is handled correctly. This might involve special handling or checks for leap year date calculations when the date adjustment crosses into a non-leap year or a month with fewer days. Specifically, verify and adjust how the `add` method calculates the new month and day when the starting point is February 29 and the operation is a decrement of months.
