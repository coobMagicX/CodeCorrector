Intent: The test case `testIssue303` seems intended to verify that the method `checkMarkedCalls` correctly identifies and tracks function calls and their effects on object properties, particularly in asynchronous callbacks and methods modifying object properties. The test checks how property modifications in constructors and prototype methods are managed and whether they are correctly recognized as local or non-local changes.

Repair strategy: The error in the source code likely resides in the handling of property assignments within asynchronous functions or closures, as well as the tracking of object property changes through method calls. The `evaluatesToLocalValue` function should be revised to better handle cases where properties of objects are modified through prototype methods, ensuring these modifications are traced correctly through asynchronous callbacks. This may involve enhancing the logic in the `Token.CALL` and related cases to analyze the context of the call (such as closures capturing `this`). Furthermore, improving the handling of the `Token.NEW` case in the source code to account for object aliasing and property assignments post-construction could be necessary to pass the test. Adjustments should ensure that property modifications are linked to their respective object instances and recognized correctly within their scope and context, including asynchronous environments.
