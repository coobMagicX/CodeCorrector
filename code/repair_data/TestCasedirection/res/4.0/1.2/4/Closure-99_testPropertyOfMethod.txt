Intent: The test case `testPropertyOfMethod` is intended to verify that the `shouldTraverse` method correctly handles scenarios where a function is assigned to a property of an object's prototype, specifically testing nested prototype assignments and ensuring they are not traversed if they shouldn't be.

Repair strategy: The failure seems to stem from a typo in the test case itself ("protoype" instead of "prototype") and potentially an issue in the method's logic regarding the handling of nested prototype properties. The key directions for repair are:
1. Correct the typo in the test case from "protoype" to "prototype".
2. Refine the logic in `shouldTraverse` to ensure it correctly identifies and handles nested assignments to prototype properties. This may involve improving checks for nested properties that reference "prototype" to ensure that such assignments are accurately detected and handled (i.e., not traversed if the logic dictates they should be skipped).
