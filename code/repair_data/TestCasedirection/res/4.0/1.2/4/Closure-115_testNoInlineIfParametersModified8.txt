Intent: The intent of the test `testNoInlineIfParametersModified8` is to ensure that the function `f` does not get inlined when it modifies a property of its parameter `a`. This is crucial because inlining such a function could lead to incorrect behavior if assumptions about object mutability are not properly handled.

Repair strategy: Enhance the source code to detect and prevent inlining of functions that modify their object-type parameters. Specifically, adjust the handling in the section of the code that checks for side effects and mutable state effects to include checks for property assignments or other modifications to object-type parameters. This could involve analyzing the function body for any writes or mutations to properties of parameters and ensuring that such functions are marked as ineligible for inlining.
