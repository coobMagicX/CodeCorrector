Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1017` is to ensure that the method `isSafeReplacement` correctly handles scenarios where the same node reference is used repeatedly in chained property accesses. The test checks if the method can handle and validate the correctness of replacing nodes in a complex chain of properties without causing any logical errors or inconsistencies.

Repair strategy: The code should include additional checks to handle scenarios where property chains are involved in the node, especially when these chains repeat the same node object. The method should be updated to analyze the entire chain of property accesses to determine if any node along this chain is being incorrectly replaced or might lead to incorrect behavior when replaced. Enhancements might involve extending the logic in the `isSafeReplacement` method to recursively or iteratively validate each node in the property chain, ensuring the integrity and safety of replacements in more complex expressions.
