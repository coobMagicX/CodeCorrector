Intent: The purpose of the test cases is to ensure that the `getOffsetFromLocal` method accurately handles the transition of time during the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST) in Moscow. The method should correctly calculate the time offset as local time moves back from DST (summer time) to standard time in autumn, particularly around the time when clocks are set back.

Repair strategy: Given the failure in the transition period test at "2007-10-28T02:00:00.000+04:00", the source code likely does not correctly handle the overlap when local time repeats due to the end of DST. The method should properly identify and adjust for the local time that occurs twice - once in DST and once in standard time. The fix should involve adjusting the logic to ensure that the time just after the DST transition is correctly calculated, possibly by refining the conditions under which `nextTransition` is called or by more accurately determining the correct offset for times that fall within the transition hour. Ensure that the method distinguishes between the first and second occurrences of these overlapping times, returning the appropriate offset for each.
