Intent: The test case `testNoInlineDeletedProperties()` is intended to verify that the `isInlinableObject()` method correctly identifies and prevents inlining of an object's properties when such properties have been deleted. The goal is to ensure that after a property is deleted from an object, any reference to that property should not consider the property as inlined, as it should return `undefined`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isInlinableObject()` method to handle cases where a property is deleted. A possible approach would be to add functionality to track deleted properties and ensure such properties are not included in the `validProperties` set. Additionally, the logic should be adjusted to handle and return `false` when it encounters references to deleted properties, effectively preventing their inlining. This can be achieved by maintaining a set of deleted properties and checking against this set during the validation phases.
