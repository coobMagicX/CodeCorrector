Intent: The intent of the test case `testSingletonGetter1` is to verify the correct handling and optimization of singleton getter methods within the JavaScript code that uses advanced compilation options provided by the Closure Compiler. The test checks if the singleton pattern implemented using `goog.addSingletonGetter` function is optimized properly without altering the intended behavior or structure of the classes.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle the specific case of inlining singleton getter methods. This involves:
1. Enhancing the logic within the `canInline` method to explicitly detect and avoid inlining singleton getter functions or methods that are crucial to maintaining the singleton pattern.
2. Adding additional checks or conditions in the `isFunction` block that analyze the nature of the function being inlined, specifically identifying singleton getter methods and preventing their inlining.
3. Adjusting the logic that determines the context and appropriateness of inlining based on the type of function and its usage within the code, ensuring that singleton patterns are preserved and not broken by aggressive inlining optimizations.
