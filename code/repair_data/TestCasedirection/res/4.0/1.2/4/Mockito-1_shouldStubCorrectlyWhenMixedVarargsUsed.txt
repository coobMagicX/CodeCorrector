Intent: The test case `shouldStubCorrectlyWhenMixedVarargsUsed` is designed to verify that the method `doSomething` in the `MixedVarargs` class handles a mix of regular and variable arguments correctly, even when the variable argument is null.

Repair strategy: The source code should properly handle scenarios where a varargs parameter is explicitly passed as null. This involves ensuring that the code does not throw an exception or behave incorrectly when encountering null varargs. The logic within `captureArgumentsFrom` that processes varargs needs to explicitly check if the varargs array is null and handle it gracefully. This may involve adjusting the check for varargs and adding conditions to manage null inputs without causing runtime errors.
