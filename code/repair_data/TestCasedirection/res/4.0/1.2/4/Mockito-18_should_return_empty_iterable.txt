Intent: The test case `should_return_empty_iterable()` is designed to verify that the `returnValueFor` method returns an empty iterable when invoked with `Iterable.class` as the argument. This ensures that the method handles generic types correctly by providing a usable, modifiable, and initially empty instance.

Repair strategy: Modify the `returnValueFor` method to include a condition that checks if the requested type is `Iterable.class`. In such a case, return an instance of a class that implements `Iterable` (such as `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`) and is instantiated empty. This will ensure the method returns an appropriate and modifiable empty iterable when requested, thereby making the test case pass.
