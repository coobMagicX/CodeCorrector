Intent: The intent of the test case `testVersionFlag2` is to check if the application correctly handles version flag "--version". It appears that the test is designed to verify whether the application outputs version information when the version flag is passed.

Repair strategy: Review and modify the `parseArguments` method or related command-line parsing logic to ensure it properly recognizes and handles the "--version" flag. The modification should include checking for specific flags like "--version" and ensuring that the correct actions (such as displaying version info) are executed. Make sure that the `parseArguments` method doesnâ€™t incorrectly parse or ignore special flags like "--version". Include appropriate handling or forwarding logic that triggers the display of version information when this flag is encountered.
