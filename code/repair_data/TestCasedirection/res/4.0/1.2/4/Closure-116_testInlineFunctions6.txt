Intent: The intent of the test `testInlineFunctions6` is to ensure that the function `BAR_FN` can be inlined correctly when it involves more complex operations including passing function arguments and performing operations on these arguments within another function call (`nochg` in this case).

Repair strategy: Analyze how the inlining logic handles nested function calls and operations within the arguments. The source code needs to be revised to ensure that it can inline functions where the arguments of the called function involve expressions or other function calls. This might involve handling more complex dependency checks or ensuring that the state mutations within nested calls are correctly identified and managed. Additionally, ensure that the inlining process respects the original logic and execution order of the program, especially when dealing with expressions and external function calls within the function parameters.
