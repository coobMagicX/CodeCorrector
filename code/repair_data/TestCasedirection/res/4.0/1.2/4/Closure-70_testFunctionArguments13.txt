Intent: The test `testFunctionArguments13` is intended to verify that the function correctly handles argument types that are non-inferrable, specifically ensuring that a nullable type (`?boolean`) is appropriately recognized and handled within the function, despite potential type changes (from `boolean` to `null`).

Repair strategy: Examine and revise the `declareArguments` method to ensure it accurately processes and assigns types based on JSDoc annotations, particularly for nullable types. The method should correctly interpret and propagate these nullable or optional type annotations through the system. This may involve enhancing the type handling and checking mechanisms to better account for type changes and nullable types in function parameters. Adjust how the `defineSlot` method interprets and applies JSType information, ensuring it can handle cases where parameters can legally be assigned `null` despite having a non-nullable type declared.
