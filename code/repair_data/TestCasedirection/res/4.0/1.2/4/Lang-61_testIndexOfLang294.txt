Intent: The intent of the test case `testIndexOfLang294` is to verify that the `indexOf` method correctly returns -1 when searching for a substring ("three") that has been previously removed from the `StrBuilder` object.

Repair strategy: The primary focus should be to ensure that the `indexOf` method properly handles cases where the substring is not found, particularly after modifications such as deletions from the `StrBuilder`. The repair should involve:
1. Verifying the update of the `size` field after any modification to the buffer (`deleteFirst` method in this case).
2. Ensuring that the loop in `indexOf` correctly iterates over the potentially modified buffer and respects the updated `size`.
3. Checking if the `deleteFirst` method correctly updates internal state of the `StrBuilder` (like `buffer` and `size`), as these affect the outcome of subsequent `indexOf` calls.
