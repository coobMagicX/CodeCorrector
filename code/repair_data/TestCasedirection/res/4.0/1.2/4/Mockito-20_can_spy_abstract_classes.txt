Intent: The test case `can_spy_abstract_classes()` is intended to verify that the system can successfully create a spy (a partial mock that calls real methods) of an abstract class, and that this spy correctly implements and returns expected results from a method call (in this case, `getMessage()`).

Repair strategy: The error likely stems from either the improper instantiation of the abstract class (which should not be directly instantiable) or the incorrect configuration/setup of the spy to ensure that the `getMessage()` method is properly overridden or handled. To resolve the issue, the source code needs to be adjusted to ensure that:
1. Abstract classes are correctly instantiated as spy objects using a subclass or another instantiation mechanism that supports abstract class handling.
2. The method `getMessage()` is either adequately mocked or the spy setup ensures execution of real methods where applicable.
3. Ensure the spy's behavior conforms to the expected method outputs, especially for abstract methods which might not have actual implementations in the abstract class itself.
