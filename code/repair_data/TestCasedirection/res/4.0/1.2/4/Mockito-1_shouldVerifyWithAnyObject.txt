Intent: The test case `shouldVerifyWithAnyObject` intends to verify that the mocked method `varArgs` can correctly handle invocations with different types of arguments, specifically testing its behavior with both a single string argument and an array of strings.

Repair strategy: The source code should correctly handle scenarios where variable arguments (varargs) are processed both as arrays and as singular elements. From the failed test case, it appears that there is an issue with the handling of array arguments, which might be arising from improper handling of varargs in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. The repair should involve:
1. Ensuring that the method correctly identifies and processes varargs by checking if the method parameter is expected to be an array or a single element.
2. Adjusting the logic in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method to manage the extraction and processing of arguments correctly based on their expected types (either array or single object).
3. Implementing a more robust check within the loop that processes matchers to determine whether the matcher should handle a single argument or an array of arguments, and implementing logic to capture each element from the array if needed.
