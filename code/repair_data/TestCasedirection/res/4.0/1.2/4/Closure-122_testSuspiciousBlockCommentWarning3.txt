Intent: The intent of the test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning3` is to verify that the method `handleBlockComment` correctly identifies and reports a warning for comments that look like annotations but are irregularly formatted or commented out, particularly when there is a newline followed by a space before the asterisk (`*`) at the start of the comment line.

Repair strategy: Modify the condition in the `handleBlockComment` method to correctly detect annotations that come after a new line and an optional space before the asterisk. This can be achieved by adjusting the string pattern in the `indexOf` method to account for any number of spaces after the newline character before the asterisk and annotation tag (`@`). Consider using regular expressions for more robust and flexible pattern matching to handle various white spaces and comment structures.
