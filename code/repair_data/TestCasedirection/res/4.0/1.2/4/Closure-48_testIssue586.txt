Intent: The test case `testIssue586` is intended to verify that the method `MyClass.prototype.fn` is correctly enforcing its parameter requirements when called within another method `MyClass.prototype.test`. The test checks that an error is triggered when `fn` is called with incorrect arguments, specifically, it should check that the function is called with exactly one boolean argument as per its declaration.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the source codeâ€™s ability to enforce and check function parameter requirements during runtime or compile time, particularly for dynamically defined or redefined functions like `MyClass.prototype.fn` within another method. This might involve improving the function redefinition tracking mechanism or the parameter checking system in the code where functions are being re-assigned or redefined (as seen with `this.fn = function() {};` in `MyClass.prototype.test`). Ensure that the newly assigned function respects the previously declared parameter type and count constraints.
