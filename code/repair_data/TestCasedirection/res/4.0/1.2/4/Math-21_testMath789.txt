Intent: The intent of the test case `testMath789` is to verify that the Cholesky decomposition implemented in the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class correctly decomposes various real matrices into lower triangular matrices such that when these matrices are multiplied by their transposes, the original matrices are reconstructed within a very small margin of error.

Repair strategy: Given that the failure occurs specifically with matrix `m3`, which contains a row of zeros, it suggests that the algorithm might not adequately handle cases where the matrix includes zero rows or potentially zero columns. The presence of zero rows/columns could affect the computational accuracy or the logical flow, especially in checking conditions or during transformations (like square root of zero or division by zero).

1. **Modify the handling of zero rows and columns**: Add logic to properly handle cases where a row or column is entirely zero. This could include early termination of certain operations or adjustments in the index-swapping logic to avoid unnecessary computations or errors.

2. **Review and adjust floating-point comparisons**: Ensure that comparisons involving small or zero values are handled accurately, considering floating-point arithmetic issues. This may involve adjusting the threshold `small` used to determine the positive definiteness of matrix elements.

3. **Enhance error handling and exception logic**: Ensure that exceptions are thrown accurately when non-positive definite conditions are detected, especially in edge cases involving zero or near-zero values.

4. **Unit tests refinement**: Alongside code adjustments, refine or add more unit tests specifically targeting matrices with special structures (like sparse matrices, matrices with zero rows/columns, and matrices with very small values close to the machine precision limit) to ensure robustness across various input scenarios.
