Intent: The test case `testOverrideVarianceWithMathClass` is designed to check whether the `SummaryStatistics` class properly handles the use of an overridden variance implementation that calculates population variance instead of sample variance. It verifies if the variance calculation is consistent with the expected result from a new `Variance` instance initialized with `population variance`.

Repair strategy: The error suggests a mismatch between the calculated variance and the expected variance, which could be due to how `varianceImpl` is handled in the `addValue` method. To repair the source code:
1. Ensure that `varianceImpl` correctly identifies and uses the overridden implementation throughout the calculation, especially after it has been set with `setVarianceImpl`.
2. Verify that the overridden implementation (such as `new Variance(false)`) is properly utilized in all relevant calculations and is not being reset or overridden by another piece of code unintentionally.
3. Check the initialization and state management of `varianceImpl` to ensure it consistently maintains the state expected by the test, across all operations that could affect variance calculation.
