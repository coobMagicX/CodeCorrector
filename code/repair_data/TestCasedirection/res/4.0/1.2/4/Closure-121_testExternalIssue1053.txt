Intent: The intent of the test `testExternalIssue1053` is to verify that the function `inlineNonConstants` handles cases where variables are used in recursive function calls and checks if variable values are maintained consistently across the function calls.

Repair strategy: Analyze and potentially adjust the handling of recursive function calls or the reassignment of variables within such contexts in the `inlineNonConstants` method. Ensure that the method does not improperly inline variables that are modified within recursive functions, leading to value inconsistencies that would cause the test to fail. This may involve adding checks to detect recursive function scenarios and prevent inlining in such cases. Also, validate the logic of counting references and handling of initialization checks to accommodate scenarios involving function recursion and variable reassignments.
