Intent: The test case `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` intends to verify that the `normalizedStandard` method correctly normalizes periods where the months exceed 12, converting excess months into years while preserving the correct sign and keeping only the remainder months under 12.

Repair strategy: Modify the normalization logic in the `normalizedStandard` method to handle negative values for years and months correctly. This includes adjusting the calculation for years and months to account for both positive and negative values, ensuring that the division and modulus operations with negative numbers behave as expected for chronological calculations. Additionally, verify that the PeriodType used in the result strictly conforms to the expected output, which might include only months if the PeriodType specified is months. This approach should handle both negative and positive overflows from months to years and maintain the correct type constraints.
