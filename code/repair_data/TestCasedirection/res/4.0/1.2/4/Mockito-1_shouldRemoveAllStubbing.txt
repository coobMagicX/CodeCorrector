Intent: The test case "shouldRemoveAllStubbing" aims to verify that after calling the `reset(mock)` method, all previous stubbings on the mock object are removed, ensuring that the methods return their default values (in this case, `null` for object-returning methods).

Repair strategy: The issue seems related to the handling of method invocations in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method, particularly how arguments are captured and how varargs are processed. The test failure at `when(mock.objectReturningMethod(200)).thenReturn(200)` suggests a problem with how arguments of non-varargs methods are handled or matched after a reset. The repair should focus on ensuring that the `captureArgumentsFrom` method correctly processes and captures arguments for both varargs and non-varargs methods, and that the reset functionality properly clears all previous configurations or stubbings. Additionally, verify that the reset method affects the state of the mock such that it truly removes all stubbing and does not interfere with method argument processing.
