Intent: The intent of the test case `testFullRank()` is to verify that the Rectangular Cholesky Decomposition correctly decomposes a given square, symmetric positive definite matrix into its root matrix such that the product of the root matrix and its transpose approximates the original matrix within a specified precision. Additionally, it tests that the resulting root matrix is not necessarily unique by ensuring its difference from a predefined base matrix is sufficiently large.

Repair strategy: The issue in the source code seems related to the logic that determines the order and selection of elements during the decomposition, particularly in how the `index` and `swap` arrays are managed, which affects the resulting structure and values of the root matrix `b`. To address this:
1. Review and possibly revise the logic around the swapping of indices and the updating of the `index` array to ensure the correct ordering of elements for the Cholesky decomposition.
2. Investigate the calculation and updates to the `c` matrix within the loop, ensuring that the transformations maintain matrix symmetry and proper decomposition values.
3. Ensure the final construction of the `root` matrix reflects the correct row ordering as determined by the `index` array.
4. Consider adding additional debugging or logging at key steps to trace the computation values step-by-step, which can help identify where the decomposition diverges from expected results.
