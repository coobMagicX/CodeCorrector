Intent: The test case `testUnfinishedEntity` aims to check if the `translate` method can correctly handle and unescape numeric HTML entities that are unfinished (missing a semi-colon) in a string, translating them to their corresponding characters.

Repair strategy: Adjust the implementation in the `translate` method to correctly handle cases where a numeric entity does not end with a semi-colon. This involves modifying the loop that searches for the semi-colon to handle cases where the semi-colon might be missing, and ensuring that the method still processes the entity correctly up to the end of the input or until a non-numeric character is found. This might involve adjusting the condition for the loop that checks for the end of the numeric entity or adding error handling for cases where the end of the string is reached without encountering a semi-colon.
