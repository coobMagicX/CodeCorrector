Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify that the `reduce()` method correctly reduces fractions to their simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The tests also check for the proper handling of negative numbers and the preservation of the reduced fraction object when the gcd is 1, as well as special cases like zero numerators.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that the reduction of fractions is performed correctly, handling both positive and negative values appropriately and ensuring the denominator is always positive. The return of the original object when the gcd is 1 (indicating no reduction needed) should also be handled properly. Specifically, adjustments may be necessary to ensure the denominator is positive in all returned fractions and the correct object is returned when no reduction is performed. The error in the test case suggesting `assertEquals(1, result.getDenominator())` implies that the denominator might not be handled correctly when negative values or zero are involved. Ensure that the method `Fraction.getFraction()` properly normalizes the fraction, making the denominator positive and adjusting the sign of the numerator accordingly. Additionally, confirm the object identity (`assertSame()`) checks are correctly validated in scenarios where the fraction is already in its simplest form.
