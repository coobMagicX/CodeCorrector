Intent: The purpose of the test case `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_newYork_startOfYear` is to verify that the `parseInto` method correctly parses the date string "2 29" into the `MutableDateTime` object for February 29th, 2004, using a New York time zone, starting from the beginning of the year.

Repair strategy: To address the failure observed in the test case, where the expected position after parsing is not met, it is prudent to review and potentially adjust the logic in the `parseInto` method that determines the new position of the parser after processing the input date string. This involves inspecting how the `DateTimeParser` calculates and returns the position index (`newPos`) after parsing "2 29". Ensure that the parser correctly interprets the date format and updates the position index accurately. Additionally, the handling of leap years and date validation within the parser should be verified to ensure they correctly process dates like February 29th.
