Intent: The purpose of the test case `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is to ensure that the `containsAny` method correctly identifies the presence (or absence) of Unicode supplementary characters (characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP) in a given CharSequence.

Repair strategy: Modify the `containsAny` method to properly handle Unicode supplementary characters. Since Java stores supplementary characters as a pair of `char` values (a surrogate pair), the method should be updated to compare each character in `cs` not just as individual char units but as code points when necessary. This might involve using methods like `Character.codePointAt` to correctly handle characters that are represented by a pair of Java `char` values and iterate over `cs` using `Character.charCount` to properly increment the index `i`. This update will ensure that supplementary characters are correctly identified whether they are represented by one or two `char` values.
