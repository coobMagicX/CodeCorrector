Intent: The intent of the `testIssue297c` test case is to verify whether the source code can correctly identify and simplify assignment and read sequences in JavaScript functions. Specifically, it checks if an assignment within a logical `AND` operation is managed properly when followed by a function call that uses the assigned variable.

Repair strategy: The code should be adapted to handle cases where a variable is assigned and then immediately used in subsequent operations within the same expression more accurately. This might involve modifying the `isVariableReadBeforeKill` function to better track the state of variables across different parts of an expression, particularly in complex expressions involving logical operators and function calls. Consider refining how variable liveness (READ, KILL, MAYBE_LIVE) is determined in scenarios where assignments and subsequent reads occur in close proximity within expressions. This might include a more detailed analysis of the context in which a variable is used immediately following its assignment.
