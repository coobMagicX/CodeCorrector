Intent: The test case `testBug2495455` is intended to test the parsing functionality of two different `PeriodFormatter` configurations. The first formatter is custom-built with specified literals, years, months, weeks, days, and time components. The second formatter uses the standard ISO period format. The intent is to validate that both formatters can correctly parse a complex period string that includes all these components.

Repair strategy: Given that the failure occurs in `pfmt2.parsePeriod("PT1003199059S")`, which utilizes the ISO standard formatter (`ISOPeriodFormat.standard()`), it suggests there might be an issue in how the ISO standard formatter handles parsing of such detailed and potentially ambiguous period strings. The error could be due to the handling of suffixes or combining multiple time units in the standard parser implementation. To repair this, review and possibly adjust the parsing logic in `ISOPeriodFormat.standard()` or the underlying parser it uses to better handle complex strings, ensuring it can differentiate and correctly interpret each component, especially when similar suffixes (like "M" for both months and minutes) are involved.
