Intent: The intent of the test case "polynomial" is to verify that the Adams-Moulton integrator can handle a polynomial differential equation effectively. The test checks that the number of function evaluations meets expected thresholds for efficiency at various step counts. Specifically, for fewer steps (nSteps < 4), more evaluations are expected, while for more steps (nSteps >= 4), fewer evaluations are anticipated, indicating a more efficient integration process.

Repair strategy: Investigate the implementation of the Adams-Moulton integrator to ensure it correctly and efficiently computes derivatives and manages step sizes, especially for larger values of nSteps. Key areas to focus on include the adaptive step size control logic and error estimation part of the code. The error control might be too strict or loosely defined, causing unnecessary evaluations. Adjusting parameters related to step size control (like minReduction, maxGrowth, and safety factors) and error thresholds may help reduce the number of evaluations and make the integrator more efficient.
