Intent: The intent of the `testEventsScheduling` method is to test the integration process of a system of differential equations with specific events (sin and cos functions) scheduled at predetermined times. The test checks whether the integrator can accurately handle and execute these events as expected during the numerical integration process.

Repair strategy: The failure at `integ.integrate(sincos, t0, y0, t, y);` suggests issues in handling event detection or the execution of events during the integration. The repair strategy should focus on:
1. Verifying the event detection logic in the `EventState.evaluateStep()` method to ensure it correctly identifies the occurrence of events.
2. Checking the accuracy and correctness of the method `interpolator.getInterpolatedState()` and ensuring it correctly computes the state at event times.
3. Reviewing how changes in state during events (e.g., through `currentEvent.reset(eventT, eventY)`) are managed and ensuring they correctly influence the system's subsequent behavior.
4. Ensuring that the integration respects the bounds and precision specified, particularly when events are close to each other or near the step boundaries, which might require adjusting the step size or improving precision settings.
