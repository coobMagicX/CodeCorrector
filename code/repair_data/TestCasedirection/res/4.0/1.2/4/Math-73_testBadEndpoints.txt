Intent: The intent of the test case "testBadEndpoints" is to ensure that the solver handles invalid inputs correctly. Specifically, it aims to verify that the solver throws an IllegalArgumentException when provided with an invalid interval (e.g., maximum less than minimum) or when the function values at the endpoints do not bracket a root (i.e., the function values at both endpoints are of the same sign).

Repair strategy: Add input validation at the beginning of the "solve" method to check for:
1. Validity of the interval, ensuring that the 'min' parameter is less than the 'max' parameter. If not, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message indicating an "invalid interval".
2. Bracketing of the root, ensuring that the function values at 'min' and 'max' are of opposite signs, which is essential for methods like the Brent algorithm to work. If the function values at both endpoints do not bracket a root, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message indicating "non-bracketing".
This will ensure that the solver only proceeds with computation when the input is correctly specified and capable of potentially containing a root within the interval.
