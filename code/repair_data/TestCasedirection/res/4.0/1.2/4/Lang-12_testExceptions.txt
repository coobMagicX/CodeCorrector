Intent: The test cases are intended to check the robustness of the `random` method in handling various edge cases, particularly with negative counts and invalid input parameters, such as empty character arrays. The purpose is to ensure the method throws `IllegalArgumentException` when provided with infeasible parameters for generating random strings.

Repair strategy: Implement additional input validation in the `random` method to explicitly check for empty character arrays and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if an empty character array is provided as an input. This should be done prior to the existing checks in the method to ensure it catches this specific case early in the method execution.
