Intent: The test case `testDuplicateLocalVarDecl` is designed to check how the system handles a situation where a variable (`x`) is declared twice with conflicting types within the same function scope. The first declaration of `x` is as a function parameter of type `number`, and the second is a local variable of type `string`. The test intends to ensure that the system can correctly identify and report type inconsistencies and redefinitions in local scope variables.

Repair strategy: The source code needs a mechanism to handle and check for variable redeclarations within the same scope, particularly focusing on whether any redeclarations are changing the type of the variable. The `declareArguments` function, or a related part of the codebase, should include logic to:
1. Track all variable declarations within a function scope.
2. Compare new declarations against existing ones.
3. If a variable is redeclared with a different type, an error or warning should be generated.
4. Enhance the type-checking system to ensure consistency between declared types and used types within the same scope, especially when variables are redeclared or overshadowed.
