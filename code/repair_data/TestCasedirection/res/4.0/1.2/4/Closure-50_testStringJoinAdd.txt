Intent: The `tryFoldArrayJoin` method is intended to optimize JavaScript array `.join()` method calls by statically folding them into a single string when possible, especially when the array elements are immutable values like strings or numbers. It attempts to replace the `.join()` call with a simplified version or a single string if the entire array can be represented as such without runtime computation.

Repair strategy: To handle cases where the array contains a mix of immutable values and other expressions (like variables or function calls) that prevent complete folding, the method should be adjusted to group consecutive immutable values into single strings, but should leave other expressions as individual elements. This will ensure the output string is as simplified as possible while maintaining correct execution semantics. The specific test cases that fail suggest that the method does not currently handle scenarios where non-immutable values interrupt sequences of immutable values, which can be concatenated. The code should be modified to check sequences of immutable values and concatenate them into a single string node whenever possible, even when such sequences are interrupted by non-immutable values.
