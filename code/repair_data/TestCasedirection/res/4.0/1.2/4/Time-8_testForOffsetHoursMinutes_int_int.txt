Intent: The method `forOffsetHoursMinutes(int hoursOffset, int minutesOffset)` is intended to create a `DateTimeZone` object representing a timezone offset from UTC by the specified hours and minutes. The method should handle both positive and negative values for hours and minutes, and throw an exception if the minutes are outside the 0-59 range or if the hours are outside the -23 to 23 range.

Repair strategy: The issue in the source code appears to be with the handling of negative minute offsets when the hour offset is zero. Currently, the method only supports positive minute values when the hour is zero, as indicated by the failing test case `assertEquals(DateTimeZone.forID("-00:15"), DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(0, -15));`. To fix this, modify the code to correctly compute the total offset in minutes when minutes are negative and hours are zero, ensuring that the resulting timezone offset correctly reflects a negative offset in minutes. Adjust the conditional logic and calculations to handle this scenario properly, ensuring that negative minute offsets are processed correctly to create the intended `DateTimeZone` object.
