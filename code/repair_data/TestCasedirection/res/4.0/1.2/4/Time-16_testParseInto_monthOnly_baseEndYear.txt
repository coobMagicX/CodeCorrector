Intent: The test case `testParseInto_monthOnly_baseEndYear` aims to verify that the method `parseInto` correctly parses a string representing a month and updates the month field of a `MutableDateTime` object, while preserving other components of the date-time like year, day, hour, minute, second, and time zone.

Repair strategy: The issue might be with how the `DateTimeParserBucket` computes the new date-time values when only a partial update (month in this case) is applied to the existing `MutableDateTime` object. The day of the month might be incorrectly adjusted or not adjusted at all, leading to an unintended date value. To fix this:
1. Review the logic in `DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis` to ensure it correctly handles updates to individual fields, particularly when the update might lead to an invalid date (e.g., February 30).
2. Ensure that the day-of-month is appropriately adjusted when the month changes to a month with fewer days than the current day-of-month value.
3. Confirm that the time zone and other fields are preserved correctly during this update process.
