Intent: The test case `testRequire` is intended to verify that the function `extractClassNameIfGoog` correctly identifies and extracts class names from Google Closure Library's `goog.require` statements that are properly formatted with string literals. The test ensures that the function does not incorrectly process calls lacking string literals or formatted differently.

Repair strategy: Modify `extractClassNameIfGoog` to ensure that it only processes calls where the argument is a string literal. This involves checking the type of the node representing the argument to ensure it is a string literal before attempting to extract the class name from it. This will prevent the function from incorrectly handling `goog.require(foo)` where `foo` is not a string literal.
