Intent: The test case `testIssue297a` is intended to check the correct tracking of variable liveness across a sequence of assignments and logical operations within a single return statement. The purpose is to ensure that the variable `x` is accurately recognized as being read and reassigned before each use in the logical AND chain.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to properly handle cases where a variable is reassigned and used within the same expression, especially in complex expressions involving logical operators. The repair should focus on enhancing the `isVariableReadBeforeKill` function to account for the variable's state changes not just in straightforward assignments but also where the variable is part of more intricate expressions like chained logical operations. This might involve refining the logic that determines when a variable is considered 'KILLED' and when it is 'READ', particularly ensuring that reassignments in a logical expression do not incorrectly set the variable state to KILL prematurely.
