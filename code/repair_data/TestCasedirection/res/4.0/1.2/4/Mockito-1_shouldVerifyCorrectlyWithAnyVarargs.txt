Intent: The intent of the test case `shouldVerifyCorrectlyWithAnyVarargs` is to validate the functionality of the method `newRow` when called with variable arguments, ensuring that it can handle any string followed by any number of additional string arguments, and that the `captureArgumentsFrom` method can correctly capture and handle the invocation arguments, especially when dealing with variable-length argument lists (varargs).

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to properly support the capture and handling of arguments for methods that are called with variable arguments (varargs). The existing implementation throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` when a method with varargs is detected, which directly leads to the failure of handling such cases. The repair should involve:
1. Removing or modifying the block that throws `UnsupportedOperationException` to instead properly handle varargs.
2. Ensure that the loop processing the matchers correctly differentiates between regular arguments and varargs, capturing each element of a vararg array individually.
3. Revising the logic to avoid prematurely exiting the loop (`return` statement) when varargs are processed, unless this is the intended behavior after all varargs are processed. Ensure other potential matchers or operations are not skipped erroneously.
4. Implement or refine the `isVariableArgument` and `isVarargMatcher` checks to accurately determine when an argument is part of varargs and when a matcher is suitable for varargs, ensuring that the capture logic is appropriately applied.
