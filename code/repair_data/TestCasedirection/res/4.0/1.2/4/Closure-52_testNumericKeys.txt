Intent: The test case intends to check if the function `isSimpleNumber` correctly identifies strings that represent simple numeric values, which can be directly used as numbers, and distinguishes them from non-numeric strings or numbers in different formats, such as octal or hexadecimal.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isSimpleNumber` method to correctly identify and handle numeric strings in various formats. This includes:
1. Recognizing octal, hexadecimal, and floating-point number formats in addition to plain decimal numbers.
2. Ensuring that strings explicitly marked with quotes ('010', '0x10', '0.2') are not treated as simple numeric values since they are intended to be string representations.
3. Adjust the logic to handle cases where the numeric string starts with symbols like '0x' for hexadecimals or contains a dot for floating-point numbers, ensuring these are not falsely identified as simple decimal numbers.
