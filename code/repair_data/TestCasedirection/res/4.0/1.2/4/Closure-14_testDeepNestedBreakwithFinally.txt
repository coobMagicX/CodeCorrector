Intent: The purpose of the failing test case "testDeepNestedBreakwithFinally" is to verify the control flow graphâ€™s accurate modeling of behavior in nested loops and try-finally structures, specifically testing the correct handling of a `break` statement that exits multiple levels up through a series of `finally` blocks.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the handling of control flow when exiting nested structures, particularly with break statements through finally blocks. The source code should be reviewed and possibly updated to ensure that when a break statement is encountered, all nested finally blocks are correctly executed in sequence before the break transfers control to its target. This might involve modifying the way `computeFollowNode` or related methods handle the navigation through AST nodes to ensure that all intermediate finally blocks are processed correctly. Ensure that control flow edges are correctly created for nodes inside finally blocks when a break statement is encountered.
