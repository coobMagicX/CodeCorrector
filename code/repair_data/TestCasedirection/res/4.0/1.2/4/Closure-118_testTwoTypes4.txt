Intent: The test `testTwoTypes4` aims to verify the behavior of modifying properties of objects created from constructors, ensuring that properties set on prototype objects and subsequently on instances behave correctly. The test involves two similar setups with different syntax (dot notation vs bracket notation) for property assignment, checking if the system can handle both notations without errors.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly handle property accesses and modifications made using different notations (dot notation and bracket notation). Since the failure occurs specifically in the test scenario where different object types (`Foo` and `Bar`) and different property access notations are mixed, the code needs to be enhanced to differentiate and process these cases correctly. The repair might involve refining how properties are fetched and set in the `handleObjectLit` method, ensuring that the property type and access method do not cause inconsistencies or errors. This could include adding checks or logic to manage different property access notations uniformly and ensuring that such access does not lead to incorrect type assumptions or processing paths in the code.
