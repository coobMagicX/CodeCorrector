Intent: The test case `testOutOfBounds` is designed to ensure that the `translate` method can gracefully handle and ignore incomplete numeric entity references at the end of a string without throwing exceptions or going out of bounds in string index.

Repair strategy: Modify the `translate` method to include checks for bounds when incrementing `end` to avoid going beyond the length of the input string. Additionally, ensure that when conditions for a complete entity (like the presence of a semicolon) are not met, the method should return without attempting to parse or write an entity. This can be achieved by checking if `end` has reached the end of the string before attempting to parse and by safeguarding against index out of bounds when checking characters in the string.
