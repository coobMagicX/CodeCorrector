Intent: The intent of the test case `testRemoveGlobal3` is to verify that the function `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` does not remove function arguments that are not referenced when the `removeGlobal` setting is false. The test checks that the argument `x` in the inner function `y` is preserved even though it is not used within `y`.

Repair strategy: The code should include a check for the `removeGlobal` flag before deciding whether to remove unused function arguments. If `removeGlobal` is false, the function should avoid modifying the argument list of any function, ensuring that the function arguments are preserved as they are, regardless of whether they are used or not. This will prevent the removal of unreferenced arguments in non-global modification settings and make the test pass.
