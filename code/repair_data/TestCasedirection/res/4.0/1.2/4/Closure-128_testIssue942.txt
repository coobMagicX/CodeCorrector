Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue942` seems to be to test the functionality of a formatting or minifying tool for JavaScript objects, ensuring that unnecessary spaces in the object's representation are removed correctly to produce a more compact version.

Repair strategy: The provided source code function `isSimpleNumber` checks if a given string consists only of numeric characters and does not begin with '0'. However, the test case `testIssue942` and its intent suggest that the function under test should handle JavaScript object formatting or minification, not numeric validation. The repair strategy should involve either:
1. Modifying the existing source code to correctly handle JavaScript object formatting, which involves parsing and reconstructing the string without unnecessary spaces.
2. Introduce a new function or modify the testing framework to correctly test the intended functionality of JavaScript object minification, ensuring that the function being tested is appropriate for the kind of operation being performed in the test case.
