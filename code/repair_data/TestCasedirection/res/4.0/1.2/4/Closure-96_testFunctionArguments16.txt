Intent: The test case is intended to validate that the function `g`, which accepts a variable number of arguments of type `number`, correctly identifies type mismatches in the actual arguments provided in calls to the function. Specifically, the test checks that when a boolean value is passed as the second argument, an error is raised indicating a type mismatch, as the function expects only numbers or undefined values.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the type-checking logic in the `visitParameterList` method to ensure it can properly handle functions with variable arguments (`var_args`). The method should be capable of correctly iterating through each argument provided in a function call and match each against the expected type specified in the function definition. If the function is declared to accept a variable number of a specific type, the code should validate that all additional arguments conform to this type. Ensure that the type-checking mechanism differentiates between standard and variable arguments and applies the correct validation rules accordingly.
