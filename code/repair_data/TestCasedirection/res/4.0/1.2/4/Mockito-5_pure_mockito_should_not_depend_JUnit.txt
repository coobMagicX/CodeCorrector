Intent: The test case `pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit` is intended to verify that the Mockito API does not have any dependencies on JUnit. It creates a class loader that excludes JUnit and loads classes related to Mockito, then checks if these classes can function independently without JUnit.

Repair strategy: Investigate and revise the `checkDependency` method or its underlying implementation to ensure it correctly identifies and handles the absence of JUnit dependencies in the provided classes. The source code may need adjustments in how it manages dependencies or error handling when JUnit classes are not available. Ensure that the verification process within the `verify` method in the source code does not implicitly rely on JUnit, or adjust the test setup to more accurately reflect situations where JUnit is unavailable.
