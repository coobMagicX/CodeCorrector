Intent: The intent of the test case (testMath272) is to verify the functionality of the SimplexSolver method in solving a linear optimization problem. The problem involves minimizing a linear objective function subject to three linear constraints. The test checks if the solution computed by the solver meets the expected values for the decision variables and the objective function value.

Repair strategy: The error in the source code likely originates from how coefficients are being reset to zero when a certain condition is met within the nested loops of the getSolution method. This resetting may be incorrectly affecting the value of `coefficients[2]`, which is expected to be 1.0 as per the test but is likely being set to 0 due to improper handling of indices or conditions within the loop. A potential repair strategy would involve carefully reviewing and potentially revising the logic inside the nested loop that modifies the coefficients array, ensuring that the correct conditions are checked and that the resetting of coefficients does not occur improperly. Additionally, verifying the logic that handles basicRow and the conditions under which coefficients are set to zero could be crucial.
