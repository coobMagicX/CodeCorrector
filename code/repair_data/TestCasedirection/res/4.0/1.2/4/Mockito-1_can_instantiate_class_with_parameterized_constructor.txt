Intent: The intent of the test case `can_instantiate_class_with_parameterized_constructor` is to verify if an instance of a class with a parameterized constructor can be created successfully using a `FieldInitializer` object. The test case checks whether the object is not null after initialization, which would confirm successful instantiation.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy involves ensuring that the `FieldInitializer` correctly handles and initializes fields using the provided `ConstructorArgumentResolver`. It appears that the instantiation process might be failing due to improper handling of constructor parameters or the constructor itself within `FieldInitializer`. The key direction for repair would be to check and possibly update the logic in `FieldInitializer` that involves fetching the constructor, resolving constructor parameters using the provided resolver, and handling any exceptions or errors during object creation. This might also include verifying and adjusting the integration or interaction between `FieldInitializer` and `ConstructorArgumentResolver` to ensure that all necessary constructor parameters are appropriately resolved and passed.
