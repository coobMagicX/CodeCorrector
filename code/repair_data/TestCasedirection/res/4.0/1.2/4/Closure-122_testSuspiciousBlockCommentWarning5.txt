Intent: The test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning5` is intended to check if the method `handleBlockComment` correctly identifies suspicious comments within a block comment that starts with `/*` and contains an annotation-like line starting with `* @`, even if it is not directly following the `/*` start tag.

Repair strategy: Modify the `handleBlockComment` method to more reliably detect lines within block comments that start with any amount of whitespace followed by `* @`. This could involve using a regular expression to search for lines that match the pattern of a potential annotation start within the entire comment block, rather than just checking for `/* @` or `\n * @`. This will ensure that lines with additional spaces or tabs before `* @` are also considered.
