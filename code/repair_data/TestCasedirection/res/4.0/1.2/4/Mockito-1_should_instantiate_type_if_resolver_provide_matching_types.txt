Intent: The test case `should_instantiate_type_if_resolver_provide_matching_types` aims to verify that the `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` correctly instantiates an object with dependencies provided by a resolver. The dependencies in this case are an `Observer` and a `Map` which are expected to be injected into the `withMultipleConstructor` field of the test class after instantiation.

Repair strategy: The source code likely has an issue in handling the instantiation or injection process for objects with multiple dependencies. The specific error could be related to how constructor parameters are resolved and assigned, or how the `resolver` is used to fetch and instantiate the required dependencies. The repair should focus on:
1. Ensuring that `ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator` correctly identifies and matches constructor parameters with the provided types.
2. Verifying that all dependencies are correctly instantiated and assigned to the respective fields or constructor parameters.
3. Checking for any exceptions or logical errors that might be occurring during the instantiation and injection process.
