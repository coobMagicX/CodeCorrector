Intent: The test case `testOverridingString1` is likely intended to check whether the code can handle string concatenation expressions in the definition of a `@define` variable correctly, ensuring that the concatenated result is treated as a valid value for the definition.

Repair strategy: Enhance the `isValidDefineValue` function to correctly handle scenarios where the node type is a binary operation (such as addition for strings). This could involve checking if both operands of a binary operation like `+` are valid strings, or recursively validating each child node in the case of nested binary operations. Update the switch cases in the `isValidDefineValue` method to handle `Token.ADD` or similar tokens used for string concatenation, ensuring that both children of the node are valid strings or valid defined values.
