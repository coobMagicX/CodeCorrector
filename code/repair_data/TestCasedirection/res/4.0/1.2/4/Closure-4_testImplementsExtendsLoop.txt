Intent: The test case `testImplementsExtendsLoop` is intended to check for and handle inheritance cycles within the type system of the JavaScript closure compiler. Specifically, it tests the scenario where a type `F` extends a type `G` which in turn implements `F`, forming a cycle.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the cycle detection and handling logic within the type resolution mechanism. This could involve refining the `detectImplicitPrototypeCycle` method in the `resolveInternal` function or elsewhere in the type resolution process to better identify and report cycles involving both `@implements` and `@extends`. Additionally, ensuring that the error handling (e.g., `handleTypeCycle`) is robust and correctly interrupts or reports the cycle to prevent further processing of such types may be necessary.
