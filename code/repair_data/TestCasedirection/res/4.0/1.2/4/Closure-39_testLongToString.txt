Intent: The test `testLongToString` is intended to verify that the method `toStringHelper` can correctly format the output string for a `JSType` object with multiple properties, both in a standard and pretty-printed form. This test checks whether the method can handle more properties than the defined threshold (`MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES`) and if appropriately it truncates the output with an ellipsis ("...") after the threshold.

Repair strategy: The failure suggests that the method might not be properly truncating the output when the number of properties exceeds `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES`. The repair should focus on ensuring that when the property count exceeds this threshold, the string truncation with "..." is correctly implemented. Additionally, the logic differentiating between the standard and annotation-specific string outputs (`forAnnotations` parameter) might need refinement to ensure that both outputs adhere to expected formats under varying conditions. Ensure the loop and condition handling within `toStringHelper` respect the `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` and implement relevant logic to handle both `prettyPrint` states correctly (i.e., reverting `prettyPrint` back to true at the end might be affecting subsequent operations).
