Intent: The test case `testGetprop4` intends to ensure that the method `visitGetProp` correctly handles situations where the object on which properties are being accessed is `null`. The test checks that the error handling for accessing properties on non-object types (like `null`) is properly reported.

Repair strategy: Modify the `visitGetProp` method to add a condition checking explicitly for `null` types before property access operations are allowed to proceed. This should include a check right after retrieving the `childType` to determine if the type is `null` and if so, to report an appropriate error message, similar to the one expected in the test case. Additionally, ensure that this check correctly differentiates between `null` and valid object types to avoid misclassification.
