Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue168b` is to ensure that the method `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` correctly handles the removal of function arguments that are not used within the function body without altering the overall functionality of the code. The test checks whether the unused parameter `x` in the nested function can be safely removed without affecting the recursive calls between functions `a` and `b`.

Repair strategy: The likely error in the source code is that it does not properly handle cases where the `removeGlobal` flag is false, which should ideally prevent the removal of any function arguments regardless of their usage within the function. The repair direction should involve modifying the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method to check the state of the `removeGlobal` flag before proceeding with the removal of unreferenced arguments. If `removeGlobal` is false, the method should either skip the removal process entirely or adjust its behavior to preserve the function arguments. This ensures that function signatures are not altered when global removal is not desired, maintaining the integrity and expected behavior of the function's external interfaces, particularly in cases where function length or argument structure may be significant.
