Intent:
The test case intends to validate that a mock object of the `Message` class can be correctly instantiated using its constructor and that its initial state (specifically, a message string) is set as expected.

Repair strategy:
1. Ensure that the mocking framework supports instantiation via constructors, particularly when the mocked class has initial state setup in the constructor.
2. Review and possibly modify the `classInstantiator.instantiate` method in the source code to correctly handle instantiation when constructor usage is specified in the mock settings.
3. Confirm that the mock settings (`withSettings().useConstructor()`) are correctly interpreted and applied during the mock creation process, ensuring that the constructor is indeed called, initializing the object state as intended.
