Intent: The intent of the test case `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_monthsWeeks` is to verify that the `normalizedStandard` method correctly normalizes a `Period` object based on a specified `PeriodType` that includes months, weeks, and days. The test checks that the method transforms the period fields such as weeks into the equivalent number of days when the field weeks are not supported in the specified `PeriodType`.

Repair strategy: The key repair direction should involve modifying the `normalizedStandard` method to accurately handle the conversion of weeks into days when the resultant `PeriodType` does not support weeks. Specifically, when the `PeriodType` only includes months and days, the method should convert weeks into the equivalent number of days and add these to the days field. Adjust the logic that redistributes the period fields to honor the constraints imposed by the `PeriodType`, ensuring that unsupported fields (like weeks in this case) are converted and summed into the supported fields correctly.
