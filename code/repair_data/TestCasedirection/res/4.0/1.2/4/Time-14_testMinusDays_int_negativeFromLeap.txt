Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to ensure that the method `minusDays` correctly handles the addition of days to a `MonthDay` object representing February 29 (a leap day), such that adding a negative number of days (equivalent to moving forward in time) correctly transitions into the next month.

Repair strategy: Review and potentially adjust the implementation of the `minusDays` method in the `MonthDay` class, ensuring that it accurately handles transitions between months, especially around leap years and edge cases such as February 29. Specifically, the logic that calculates the new month and day when adding or subtracting days needs to be verified or corrected to handle leap years appropriately. Additionally, ensure that the chronology used (ISOChronology) is consistently applied when calculating new dates and creating `MonthDay` instances in the test case and the method implementation.
