Intent: The intent of the failing test case `should_report_when_constructor_is_explosive` is to ensure that the method `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks` properly handles and reports an error when attempting to initialize a mock (spy) for a class that throws an exception from its constructor.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to effectively handle and report exceptions thrown during the instantiation of mocks, especially from constructors. The exception handling within the `createMock` method might need to be revised to catch and handle specific exceptions related to object creation more gracefully. This could involve checking and reporting issues related to constructor exceptions directly, rather than handling them through general instantiation exceptions. Further, the test message assertion might need refinement to catch specific error messages related to constructor issues.
