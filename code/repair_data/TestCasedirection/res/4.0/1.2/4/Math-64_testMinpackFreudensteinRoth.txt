Intent: The purpose of the test cases is to verify the optimization algorithm's ability to find local minima for the Freudenstein-Roth function, a commonly used test function in optimization, starting from different initial points and checking if the optimizer correctly converges to the expected solutions.

Repair Strategy: Based on the failing test case and the analysis of the source code, potential issues could arise from numerical stability or convergence criteria not being adequately met for certain initial conditions. A key direction for repair might involve:
1. Reviewing the update and calculation mechanisms for `delta`, `lmPar`, and convergence checks to ensure they handle large variations in initial parameters robustly.
2. Adjusting the orthogonality checks and ensuring the stopping criteria are suitable for widely varying scales of input values and function landscapes.
3. Verifying and potentially refining the calculation of `jacNorm` and its use in scaling and convergence checks, as issues in these areas could lead to incorrect optimization behaviors for inputs of different scales.
