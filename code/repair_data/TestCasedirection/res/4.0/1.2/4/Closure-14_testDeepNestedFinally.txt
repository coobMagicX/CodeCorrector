Intent: The intent of the test `testDeepNestedFinally` is to ensure proper control flow edges are created in deeply nested `finally` blocks within try-catch structures, specifically testing edge cases for exception handling and unconditional branching.

Repair strategy: Review and correct the logic within the `computeFollowNode` method to ensure proper handling of control flow transitions between `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, especially focusing on transitions triggered by exceptions (`Branch.ON_EX`). This could involve ensuring that exception handling paths are correctly identified and linked in the control flow graph, and that all potential paths, including deep nesting and branches due to exceptions, are accurately represented. Additionally, verify if the logic is correctly considering and processing nodes related to `Token.IF` inside `finally` blocks. Adjustments may be needed in how `computeFollowNode` considers sibling and parent nodes, especially in complex nested scenarios like the one presented in the test case.
