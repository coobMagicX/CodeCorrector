Intent: The test case `testDontRemoveBreakInTryFinally` aims to validate that the `tryMinimizeExits` function preserves the `break` statement inside a `finally` block within a `try-catch-finally` structure. This is critical because altering the flow control in a `finally` block can lead to unintended behavior, particularly in structures designed to handle or cleanup after exceptions.

Repair strategy: Modify the `tryMinimizeExits` function to ensure it does not alter or remove `break`, `return`, or other control statements within a `finally` block of a `try-catch-finally` structure. This could involve adding checks that prevent `tryMinimizeExits` from minimizing exits when the node represents a `finally` block. Specifically, consider implementing a condition that bypasses exit minimization logic for `finally` blocks or more carefully manages how nodes within `finally` are processed to respect the unique semantic requirements of `finally` in exception handling.
