Intent: The test `testExpressionInForIn` is intended to check if the variable 'a' is live before the label 'X' in the loop `for (a[1] in foo) { }`. This is to verify that the handling of the 'for-in' loop correctly identifies and tracks variable usage, especially when the loop's left-hand side (lhs) is not a simple variable declaration but an array element assignment.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the handling of the `Token.FOR` case in the `computeGenKill` function, especially for scenarios where the left-hand side of the 'for-in' is an expression rather than a plain variable. The current logic assumes the lhs is either a variable declaration or a simple variable, but it does not account for more complex expressions like `a[1]`. The repair should include:
1. Enhancing the `addToSetIfLocal` function or its usage to handle complex expressions such as array elements.
2. Ensuring that such expressions do not mistakenly contribute to the `kill` set when they should contribute to the `gen` set, thus keeping the variable 'a' live as expected by the test case.
