Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1058` is to evaluate the type-checking capabilities of the function `inferTemplatedTypesForCall` when handling JavaScript code that involves generics and template types. The JavaScript code snippet defines a generic class `Class` with a method `foo` which is supposed to take a function parameter and return a value. The test checks if the function can handle incorrect types passed to the generic method and infer appropriate template types, ensuring type safety.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the method `inferTemplatedTypesForCall` to handle cases where the types of the parameters do not match the expected generic types. The source code should be modified to:
1. Validate the types of the arguments passed to the function against the expected generic types.
2. Include error handling or type correction when the inferred types from the parameters do not align with the template types defined in the function signature.
3. Improve logging or error messaging within the test to specify why the type inference fails, if applicable, to aid in debugging and ensure the test's intent is clear.
