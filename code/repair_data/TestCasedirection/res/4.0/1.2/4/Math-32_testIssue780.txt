Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testIssue780` is to validate the computational accuracy of the `PolyhedronsSet` class in determining the size (volume) of a 3D polyhedron defined by given vertices and indices. The test checks if the computed size of the polyhedron closely matches the expected value (8.0) with a very small tolerance (3.0e-6).

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the computation logic within the `PolyhedronsSet` class or related computational geometry methods that affect the calculation of the polyhedron's size. Ensure that numerical precision issues, particularly with floating-point operations, are handled correctly. This might involve refining how vertices are processed, ensuring accurate geometric calculations in the `Plane` and `PolygonsSet` classes, or adjusting the tolerance within the test case if the existing logic is theoretically correct but practically faces precision limitations.
