Intent: The test `testLargeSample` aims to validate the accuracy of polynomial fitting using the `PolynomialFitter` class. It generates random polynomials of various degrees, fits observed noisy data points to these polynomials, and then checks that the fitted polynomial does not deviate from the original polynomial by more than 0.01 at any given point in the tested range. It also asserts that there is a significant fitting error (`maxError > 0.001`), ensuring that the fitting process is non-trivial and that there is observable deviation due to noise.

Repair strategy: Given that the failing line is `PolynomialFunction fitted = new PolynomialFunction(fitter.fit(init));`, the issues could stem from improper initialization of parameters, inadequate optimizer settings, or numerical instability in the fitting process. A repair strategy could involve:
1. Reviewing and potentially adjusting the initial guess `init` to ensure it's suitable for starting the fitting process. This might involve setting more informed initial values based on the degree of the polynomial.
2. Tuning the `LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer` parameters, such as the convergence threshold, maximum iterations, or dampening factors, to improve the robustness and accuracy of the fitting process.
3. Enhancing the robustness of the fitting process against noise and outliers by potentially adding regularization or revising the weight (`1.0` in `addObservedPoint`) assigned to each observed point.
4. Investigating numerical issues in the calculation of the polynomial values and the fitting process, ensuring that calculations maintain precision and avoid overflow or underflow.
