Intent: The purpose of the failing test case, labeled "three (Object) pct", is to validate that the method `getPct` correctly computes the percentage of a given value (in this case, the integer 3 represented as an Object) in a frequency distribution. The expected behavior is that `getPct` should correctly handle and return the percentage regardless of the type of the numeric value that is wrapped as an Object.

Repair strategy: The source code needs a robust mechanism to handle different numeric types uniformly when they are passed as arguments to `getPct`. This includes ensuring that numeric objects, irrespective of their specific class (e.g., Integer, Long), are compared correctly within the `getCumPct` method. A potential repair could involve modifying `getCumPct` to perform type-checking and appropriate type conversion, ensuring that different numeric types representing the same value are considered equal. This might involve normalizing all numeric inputs to a common type (like converting all to Long or BigDecimal) before performing operations. Additionally, enhancing the equality and hashing mechanisms (if a collection like a HashMap is used internally) to treat different numeric types equivalently could also be necessary.
