Intent: The test case `testMath781` intends to verify that the simplex solver correctly optimizes a linear objective function subject to given constraints. It expects certain variable values in the solution to be greater than, less than, or equal to specified thresholds and checks if the optimal value is as expected.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests a problem with how the `dropPhase1Objective` function processes the tableau or manages columns, particularly non-basic variables and their coefficients. It seems like the function could be incorrectly modifying the tableau or mismanaging the indices of columns to be dropped, leading to incorrect calculations in the simplex algorithm.

1. Review the loop that identifies columns to be dropped to ensure it correctly identifies all necessary columns without erroneously including or excluding others.
2. Verify the logic for updating the tableau and reducing the set of artificial variables to confirm it reflects the intended logic after dropping the specified columns.
3. Check and correct the indexing and bounds within loops and conditional statements to prevent off-by-one or similar errors.
4. Enhance the checks or conditions under which columns are added to `columnsToDrop` to ensure only appropriate columns that meet the specified conditions (e.g., non-basic artificial variables) are considered.
5. Debug and trace the values of variables and tableau entries throughout the function to ensure the correct implementation of the simplex algorithm logic. Adjustments might be necessary to the handling of artificial variables or the criteria used for selecting columns to drop.
