Intent: The purpose of the test case `testBug4944818` is to verify the correctness of function inlining, where function calls in one method (`launchHangout`) are replaced with the body of the called functions (`getDomServices_` and `getOwnerWin_`). The test checks whether the inlining preserves the functionality and ensures that there are no side effects or state mutations that would change the behavior.

Repair strategy: Address the handling of side effects and state changes during function inlining in the source code. Specifically, ensure that:
1. The inlining process checks for any side effects from the function being inlined and from the arguments passed to it.
2. The state mutations, especially through properties like `domServices_`, are properly handled during inlining.
3. The inlining logic accurately replaces the function call with the function body and correctly manages the scope and lifetime of any temporary variables introduced during inlining.
4. Add checks or modify existing ones to ensure that properties and states accessed or modified within the inlined function do not violate any preconditions or expected states outside the function scope.
