Intent: The test case `testInlineIfParametersModified8` intends to verify that the function `f` can correctly modify the property of an object passed as an argument and ensure that the modification reflects in the output without inlining the function call if the modification affects the program's state.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to handle cases where object properties are directly modified within the function. This might involve adjusting the condition checks around `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` and `NodeUtil.getNameReferenceCount` to correctly account for modifications to object properties, which should not block the inlining if it meets the intended outcome. Ensure that the state changes are tracked and managed appropriately so that the function can still be inlined if it does not lead to incorrect behavior or side effects that contradict the expected output of the function.
