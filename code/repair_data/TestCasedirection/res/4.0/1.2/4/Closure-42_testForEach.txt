Intent: The test case aims to verify that the method `processForInLoop` can correctly parse and transform a JavaScript `for each` loop, which is a non-standard extension of JavaScript primarily supported in old versions of Mozilla's JavaScript engines.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a condition that checks for the `for each` loop syntax and either processes it correctly or throws a more descriptive error. Since `for each` is not a standard JavaScript construct and may not be intended for support, the strategy might also include extending the parser's capability to recognize this syntax if supporting legacy code is a goal. Alternatively, updating the parser to explicitly state that `for each` is not supported can help clarify the limitations to the users.
