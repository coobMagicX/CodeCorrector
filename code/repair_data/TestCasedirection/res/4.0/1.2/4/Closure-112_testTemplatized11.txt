Intent: The test case `testTemplatized11` is designed to check if the method `inferTemplatedTypesForCall` can handle a templated class constructor and its method which uses multiple type templates correctly. The method in question uses a compound type parameter `(T|K)` and is supposed to return a type `T`. The test ultimately checks whether the type inference correctly resolves and applies these template types in a function call, and ensures the correct type is returned and assigned.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure it properly handles multiple template types in both the parameters and return types of functions. The key areas to focus on include:
1. Enhancing the `inferTemplateTypesFromParameters` method to ensure it can accurately infer types when a function parameter is a union of template types (e.g., `T|K`).
2. Ensuring that the `TemplateTypeReplacer` and the function `visit` method correctly replace all occurrences of the template types with the inferred or default types, without losing information especially in complex scenarios involving multiple or nested template types.
3. Adding robust null checks and error handling to manage scenarios where template types cannot be resolved, and ensuring that these do not propagate incorrect types.
4. Adjusting the test environment setup in `testTypes` to correctly simulate the complex templating scenarios presented in the test case script, ensuring the environment is representative of typical use cases.
