Intent: The intent of the test case `should_evaluate_latest_stubbing_first` is to verify that the mocked method `objectReturningMethod` returns values based on the most recent stubbing for its inputs. Specifically, the test checks whether the method prioritizes newer stubbing rules over older ones and returns default values (null) when input doesnâ€™t match any stubbing rule.

Repair strategy: Investigate the handling of different argument types and overriding of stubbing in the mocking framework. Ensure that the stubbing logic correctly checks for the type and value of arguments being passed. Update the method to respect the order of stubbing, where the most recent stubbing takes precedence. This could involve refining the logic that stores and retrieves the stubbing rules or the matching mechanism that determines which rule to apply based on the arguments provided. Ensure that the framework supports type-specific responses and handles default cases when no specific stubbing is found.
