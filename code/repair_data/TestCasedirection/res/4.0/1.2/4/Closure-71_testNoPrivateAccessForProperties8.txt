Intent: The test case `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties8` is intended to verify that a private property `bar_` defined in a parent class `Foo` cannot be overridden by a subclass `SubFoo` with the same private visibility modifier. This is to ensure that the encapsulation and visibility constraints of object-oriented principles are adhered to in the JavaScript code.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to properly handle the check for private properties being overridden in subclasses. The focus should be on improving the condition that checks whether a private property from a superclass is being illegally overridden in a subclass with a different or same visibility level. The repair should involve ensuring that the `overridingVisibility` is compared correctly against the superclass's property visibility and that the input source (file) is also considered when determining the visibility scope to prevent private properties from being overridden or accessed incorrectly. Additionally, the check for whether the subclasses are in the same file as the superclass should be validated to ensure private properties are not overridden across different files.
