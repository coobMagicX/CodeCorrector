Intent: The test case `testIssue297f` is intended to verify if the code transformation correctly simplifies expressions involving assignments and subsequent use of the same variable, ensuring that the semantics of the original code are preserved.

Repair strategy: The source code function `isVariableReadBeforeKill` needs to correctly handle cases where a variable is assigned and then used in subsequent expressions within the same statement. The current logic may not accurately maintain the state of the variable (KILL, READ, or MAYBE_LIVE) across such compound expressions. To repair this, enhance the logic to manage and track the state transitions of the variable more accurately throughout the evaluation of complex expressions, ensuring that each assignment and usage within a single expression correctly updates the state of the variable. This might involve refining the condition checks or the recursive descent into child nodes to ensure that variable states (READ and KILL) are correctly identified and handled, especially in nested or sequential operations within a single expression.
