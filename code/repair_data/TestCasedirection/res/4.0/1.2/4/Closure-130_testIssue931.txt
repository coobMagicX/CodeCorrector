Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue931` is to verify that the `inlineAliases` method correctly handles JavaScript closures and does not erroneously inline or modify references that are captured by closures, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `inlineAliases` method properly checks and handles cases where variables (like `args` in the test case) are used in closures, especially when these variables are captured in functions like `setTimeout`. The repair should involve adding a condition to check if a variable is used in a closure and, if so, to skip inlining or modifying these references. This could be achieved by maintaining a context or a flag within the scope analysis to identify when a variable is part of a closure and should be treated differently.
