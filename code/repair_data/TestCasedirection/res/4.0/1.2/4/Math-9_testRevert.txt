Intent: The intent of the test case `testRevert` is to verify that the `revert` method of the `Line` class correctly creates a new `Line` instance with its direction vector negated (i.e., multiplied by -1), relative to its original line.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to ensure that the `revert` method correctly negates the direction vector of the line. The existing implementation seems to use `zero.subtract(direction)`, which might not be correctly negating the vector depending on the implementation of `subtract` and whether `zero` is correctly defined and used. The repair should involve directly negating the direction vector, possibly by using a method specifically designed to negate vectors (like a `negate()` method, if available) or by multiplying the vector components by -1 explicitly. Ensure that the `zero` vector (if used) is defined as a vector with all components equal to 0.
