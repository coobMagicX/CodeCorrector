Intent: The intent of the test case `shouldStubbingWork` is to verify that the method stubbing for `iterable.iterator()` using Mockito is working correctly. The test ensures that after stubbing, the `iterator()` method of an `Iterable` object should not return `null`.

Repair strategy: The repair direction should focus on ensuring that the Mockito stubbing is correctly set up and that it is effectively overriding the `iterator()` method to return the mock object `myIterator`. This might involve checking if `iterable` is properly instantiated and is of a type that supports stubbing. Additionally, verify that `myIterator` is not `null` and that there are no issues in the way Mockito has been set up or used in the test environment. Ensure that all necessary Mockito configurations or initializations are correctly implemented.
