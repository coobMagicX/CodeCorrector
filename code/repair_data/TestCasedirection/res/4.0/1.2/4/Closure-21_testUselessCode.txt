Intent: The test cases aim to verify that the code correctly identifies and handles useless code statements or expressions that do not affect the program's state or output. These include operations that do not produce side effects or whose results are not used in any meaningful way. The test cases particularly focus on preserving expressions that might be discarded incorrectly by the compiler.

Repair strategy: Modify the function to refine how it identifies and handles expressions that are considered to have side effects, particularly in compound expressions and within loops or conditional statements. Ensure that the code accurately detects whether the results of expressions are used or if they contribute to the program's state changes. Adjust the logic that determines when to report an error or preserve a node, especially for complex expressions and in contexts like comma operators or sequence expressions inside for loops.
