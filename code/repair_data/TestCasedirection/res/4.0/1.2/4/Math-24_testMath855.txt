Intent: The test case `testMath855` is intended to verify the correct functionality of the `BrentOptimizer` in finding the minimum of a function that combines a sinusoidal function with a step function. The optimizer should locate the minimum point accurately even in the presence of small discontinuities and close to critical points in the function.

Repair strategy: Investigate and potentially revise the handling of small intervals and the precision settings in the optimizer's implementation. Adjustments may be needed in the conditions used to decide between the parabolic interpolation and the golden section step, especially around areas with rapid changes in function values due to steps or discontinuities. The convergence criteria and the handling of close-to-boundary values should be reviewed to ensure that the optimizer remains effective in the presence of small and challenging function landscapes. Consider refining the logic to better deal with edge cases where the optimizer needs to navigate near the boundaries of a step function or other sharp features in the function being optimized.
