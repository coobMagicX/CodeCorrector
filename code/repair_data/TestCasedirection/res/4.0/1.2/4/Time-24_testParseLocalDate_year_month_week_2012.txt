Intent: The test case `testParseLocalDate_year_month_week_2012` aims to validate the parsing functionality of a DateTimeFormatter that is configured to parse dates based on a format including the year, month, and week number. The test verifies that the string "2012-01-01" is correctly parsed into a LocalDate object representing January 2, 2012.

Repair strategy: There seems to be a confusion or error in handling the parsing of week number within the date string, where the week number might be incorrectly influencing the day or month component. The repair should focus on ensuring that the parsing logic correctly interprets the week number in conjunction with the year and month, without incorrectly adjusting other date components. The parsing logic in `computeMillis` should be reviewed and possibly adjusted to correctly handle formats that include week numbers. This may involve ensuring that the week number is being translated into the correct starting date of that week according to the specified calendar system used by the `Chronology` instance.
