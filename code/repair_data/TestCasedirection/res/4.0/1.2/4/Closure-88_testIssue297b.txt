Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue297b` is to verify that the function correctly identifies and processes the variable `x` being written and then read in a compound expression within the return statement. It specifically checks how the code handles the sequence of variable assignment followed by a method call on the same variable, capturing both a variable KILL (assignment) and READ (method call) event.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the sequence of operations in compound expressions, ensuring that variable liveness states are maintained accurately across chained operations. The repair should focus on:
1. Refining the logic in `isVariableReadBeforeKill` to differentiate between KILL and READ states when variables are used in complex expressions like logical AND (`&&`), especially when the variable is both assigned and subsequently accessed within the same expression.
2. Ensuring that the method correctly propagates the READ state when a variable is accessed after being assigned in the same compound expression, without being prematurely marked as KILL.
3. Adjust the traversal mechanism to better handle compound expressions where variable states can change multiple times. This might involve enhancing how child nodes are evaluated and how state changes are bubbled up through recursive calls.
