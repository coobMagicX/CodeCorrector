Intent: The test case `testQualifiedNameInference5` is intended to validate that the type-checking system correctly identifies and reports a type mismatch between the expected and actual parameters in a function call. In this specific case, the function `ns.foo` is defined to accept a number, but it is called with a boolean.

Repair strategy: Review and ensure that the type inference system within the defineSlot method properly handles qualified names (like `ns.foo`) and correctly sets up their expected parameter types when declared within different scopes or closures. The repair should focus on whether the scope handling and type propagation correctly manage function types and their parameters, especially when they are declared inside an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) and subsequently called from another scope or IIFE. This might involve checking the linkage between variable declarations and their usage across different scopes, as well as verifying if the type information is maintained accurately throughout the program execution.
