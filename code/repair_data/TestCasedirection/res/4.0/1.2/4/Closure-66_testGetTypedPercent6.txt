Intent: The test case `testGetTypedPercent6` aims to verify that the type analysis for the JavaScript object literal `a = {TRUE: 1, FALSE: 0};` is 100% complete, meaning all components of the object (keys and values) are correctly typed.

Repair strategy: Since the test fails at asserting 100% typing, it suggests an issue with how object literal keys or values are being typed in the source code. The test failure implies that either the keys ("TRUE" and "FALSE") or the values (1 and 0) are not being recognized and typed as expected. 
- Ensure that the `STRING_TYPE` is correctly assigned to the keys of the object literal, and `NUMBER_TYPE` is assigned to the values.
- Check the handling of object literals (`Token.OBJECTLIT`) in the `visit` method to ensure that all child nodes (keys and values) are being visited and typed appropriately.
- Review the `ensureTyped` method's implementation within the context of object literals to confirm that it behaves as expected for both keys and values.
