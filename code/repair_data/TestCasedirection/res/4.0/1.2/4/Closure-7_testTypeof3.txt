Intent: The test case `testTypeof3` appears to be testing the functionality of the `caseObjectType` method, specifically when the `value` is "function" and the type passed is `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`. The test checks if the method correctly identifies and handles types that should be treated as subtypes of "function" and returns the appropriate constructor type or `null` based on the result of subtype checking.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that the `resultEqualsValue` condition is accurately evaluating whether the type being checked (`U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE` in this case) is indeed a subtype of the expected "function" type. The potential issue might be related to the incorrect implementation or handling of `resultEqualsValue` and `isSubtype` checks. To repair this:
1. Verify and correct the logic used in `resultEqualsValue` to ensure it matches the test's expectations.
2. Check the `isSubtype` method (or its implementation if it's an external method) to ensure that it correctly identifies subtypes, particularly for `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`.
3. Ensure that `getNativeType(U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE)` is properly fetching the correct type and that this type is accurately checked against `ObjectType`.
4. Review the conditions under which `null` is returned to make sure they align with the intended logic.
