Intent: The intent of the test case `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is to verify that when a Mockito spy or mock is attempted to be created for a class that does not have a no-argument constructor (`HasConstructor` class in this case), a specific `MockitoException` is thrown. The exception should clearly state the inability to create a mock instance due to the absence of such a constructor, including a specific message about the missing 0-arg constructor.

Repair strategy: Modify the exception handling in the `createMock` method to ensure that when an `InstantiationException` occurs due to a missing constructor, the exception message specifically mentions the absence of a 0-argument constructor. This could involve checking the cause of the `InstantiationException` to determine if it was triggered by a missing 0-arg constructor, and then appending this detail to the exception message before rethrowing it as a `MockitoException`. This approach will make the error messages more descriptive and helpful for diagnosing constructor-related issues during mock creation.
