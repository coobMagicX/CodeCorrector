Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLeapYearRulesConstruction` is to verify that the date February 29, 1500, is correctly constructed when using a chronology that combines Julian and Gregorian rules (GJChronology). The year 1500 is a leap year in the Julian calendar but not in the Gregorian calendar.

Repair strategy: The source code in `getDateTimeMillis` should be adjusted to properly handle the transition between Julian and Gregorian calendars, especially around leap years that are recognized differently in the two systems. Ensure that when operating within a chronology that mixes both calendars (like GJChronology), the method accurately reflects the rules of both systems without incorrectly throwing an exception for valid dates in the Julian system. This might require revising the logic that checks for the cutover from Julian to Gregorian calendar, ensuring that valid Julian dates are not erroneously calculated as being in the "illegal cutover gap." Consider refining the condition that compares the instant with `iCutoverMillis` to better handle edge cases around the cutover period.
