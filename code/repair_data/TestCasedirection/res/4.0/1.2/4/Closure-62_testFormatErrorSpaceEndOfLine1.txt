Intent: The test case `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1` is designed to check if the `format` method correctly formats an error message, including the source file name, line number, error level, description, and a pointer (`^`) indicating the error's position in the provided line of source code. The test ensures that the pointer aligns correctly with the character position specified in the error details, especially handling cases where the error is at the end of the line or followed by spaces.

Repair strategy: Review and correct the logic within the `format` method that handles the placement of the pointer (`^`). Ensure that the pointer correctly aligns with the character number specified in `error.getCharno()`, even if the character is followed by spaces or at the end of the line. This may involve adjusting the loop that generates spaces before the pointer or checking the conditions under which the pointer is added. Additionally, verify that `sourceExcerpt` is correctly retrieved and used in the method, and that `error.description` corresponds to the expected output in the test case.
