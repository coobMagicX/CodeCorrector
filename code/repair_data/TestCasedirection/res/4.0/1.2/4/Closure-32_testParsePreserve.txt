Intent: The test case `testParsePreserve` is intended to verify that the `parse` method correctly preserves whitespace and line breaks within a multiline comment marked with `@preserve`, and that this preserved text is accurately captured as the license information in a `Node` object's `JSDocInfo`.

Repair strategy: The issue might lie in the handling of whitespace and line breaks when `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` is selected. The source code needs to be checked to ensure that all whitespaces, including those at the beginning of the line and line breaks, are preserved as is when the `@preserve` annotation is used. This might involve modifying conditions that alter the string (such as `trim()` operations and space additions) under the `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` setting. Ensure that the `builder` in the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method appends the exact content of the comment without unwanted modifications when this option is set.
