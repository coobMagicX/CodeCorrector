Intent: The purpose of the test case `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is to verify that the `containsAny` method can accurately determine whether a string contains any characters from a given array of characters, particularly when dealing with supplementary characters (characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP, which are represented by pairs of char values).

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `containsAny` does not adequately handle supplementary characters, as it treats the input as consisting only of BMP characters. The comparison fails when characters are represented by surrogate pairs in Java. To address this, the `containsAny` method needs to be modified to correctly handle and compare surrogate pairs. This can involve iterating over code points rather than char values, using methods like `String.codePointAt` and `Character.isSupplementaryCodePoint`. This approach ensures that both BMP characters and supplementary characters are correctly recognized and compared.
