Intent: The intent of the test `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine2` is to verify that the `format` method correctly formats a syntax error message, indicating the file name, line number, error level, description, and the specific position in the line where the error occurred. The test checks if the caret (^) is correctly placed under the erroneous character at the end of a source excerpt, even when the character is a space.

Repair strategy: Investigate and correct the logic handling the placement of the caret (^) under the erroneous character, specifically for cases where the error character is at the end of the line or is a whitespace character. Ensure the method `format` accurately computes and reflects the position of the error character in the source excerpt, especially when handling whitespace or end-of-line scenarios. Adjust the index or logic used for determining the caret position to accommodate characters that might not be visible or are at the boundary of the line.
