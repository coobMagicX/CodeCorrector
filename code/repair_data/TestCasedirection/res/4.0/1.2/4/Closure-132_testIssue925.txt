Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to optimize if-else structures into ternary operator expressions where possible, thereby reducing the code size and possibly improving readability.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to adequately handle scenarios where the condition involves side effects (like incrementing or decrementing a variable) and ensure that these side effects are correctly applied in the ternary expression. The transformation logic should ensure that the original side effects are preserved and correctly reflected when rewriting if-else structures into ternary operations. This may involve capturing the pre-condition state and applying it within the ternary operation or restructuring the ternary conversion logic to account for expressions with side effects.
