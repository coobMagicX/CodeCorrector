Intent: The test case `testParseLicense()` aims to verify that the method `parse()` correctly extracts and processes a license block from a multiline JSDoc comment, ensuring that the resulting text matches the expected format with appropriate handling of whitespace and line breaks.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the handling of whitespace and line breaks in the function `extractMultilineTextualBlock()` to ensure consistency with the expectations set in the test case. Specifically, focus on the concatenation logic within the loop that processes tokens, ensuring that spaces and line breaks are appended correctly. Also, ensure that trimming operations only affect leading and trailing whitespace without altering the internal formatting of the multiline block. The `trimEnd(line)` method might need to be verified or adjusted to ensure it does not overly strip whitespace in cases where preservation is required per the test case expectations.
