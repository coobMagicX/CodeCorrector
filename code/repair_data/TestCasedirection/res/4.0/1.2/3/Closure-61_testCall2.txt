Intent: The purpose of the code is to determine if a function call has any side effects. It checks if the call node is of type CALL, if it has side effects, and if it is a built-in function without side effects, among other conditions.

Fix strategy: The test case failure indicates that the function is incorrectly determining that `Math.sin(0)` has side effects, which is not true. Here, the error occurs because the code doesn't handle cases where the function is in the "Math" namespace. This can be fixed by adding another condition to check if the function is a part of the Math namespace and doesn't have side effects. Specifically, you can add a condition to check if the first child of the nameNode is of type "GETPROP", and the string value of the first child of the nameNode is "Math". If so, and if the last child of the nameNode is a function present in a pre-defined list of Math functions without side effects, return false.
