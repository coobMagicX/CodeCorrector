Intent: The purpose of the source code is to pretty print the properties of an object in a sorted order. It does so by first checking if the object has a reference name, if it does, it returns the reference name. If it doesn't, it checks if `prettyPrint` is set to true. If it is, it collects all the property names of the object and its prototypes until a certain limit (MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES). It then constructs a string representation of the properties in a sorted order. If the `prettyPrint` is false, it returns a string "{...}". The failing test case is intended to verify the pretty printing of properties of an object, including handling recursive properties.

Fix strategy: The issue could be that the `getPropertyType(property).toString()` call isn't handling recursive cases correctly and is returning "?" instead of "{...}" as expected. The fix would involve updating the `getPropertyType(property).toString()` method to check if the property is recursive and if so, return "{...}" instead of "?".
