Intent: The purpose of this source code is to extract a multiline textual block from a JsDocToken stream. The intent is to parse through a stream of JsDoc tokens, handle different types of tokens, and build a multiline text string. The code also handles different whitespace options and updates the state of the system accordingly.

Fix strategy: The failure seems to be due to the incorrect handling of whitespace when parsing a comment. The test case fails because it expects preserved whitespace at the beginning of each line in the comment, but the actual result doesn't match this. A possible fix could be to correct how the function handles whitespace when parsing comments. We need to update the code to preserve the whitespace at the beginning of each new line. We can achieve this by updating the conditions within the switch case for token types, specifically for the token type EOL (end of line).
