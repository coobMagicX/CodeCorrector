Intent: The intent of the source code is to infer property types of a JavaScript object to match a given constraint. If the object type doesn't have the property, the function infers and defines the property type.

The failed test case is trying to test if the function can correctly infer the property type of the returned object in a conditional (if-else) statement.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be with the handling of conditional statements. The function doesn't account for the possibility of an object having different properties in different branches of a conditional. 

A potential fix could be to modify the function so that it iterates through all branches of a conditional statement and infers properties for each branch separately. After that, it would need to combine the results, inferring the most common type for each property. If a property doesn't exist in all branches, its type should be inferred as 'undefined' or the type it has in the branches where it exists. 

Another approach could be to infer a 'union' type for such properties, combining all the types it has in different branches. However, this might lead to less accurate type checking in further code. So, the first approach is preferable. 

Please note that these changes might require significant modifications in the source code, and they should be implemented carefully, with all potential edge cases in mind.
