Intent: The intent of the source code is to compute the 'gen' and 'kill' sets for each node in a JavaScript syntax tree. These sets are used in data flow analysis, specifically in live variable analysis which is a classic dataflow problem in compiler optimizations. From the code, it appears that 'gen' and 'kill' are BitSets representing generated and killed variables at each program point, and the method `computeGenKill()` is computing these sets based on the type of the node in the syntax tree.

Fix strategy: The test case `testExpressionInForIn()` failed at the line `assertLiveBeforeX("var a = [0]; X:for (a[1] in foo) { }", "a")`. This means that the variable `a` is expected to be live before the label `X`, but it's not. The issue lies within the 'for-in' loop parsing part of the code. The current code only takes care of cases when the variable in the 'for-in' loop is a single variable (e.g., 'var x in y'). However, the failed test case is checking for a scenario where the variable is an array element (e.g., 'a[1] in foo'). 

To fix this issue, the 'for-in' loop handling code needs to be updated to handle array elements as well. Specifically, in the `Token.FOR` case, we need to add a condition to check if the `lhs` node is an array element and if so, add it to the 'gen' and 'kill' sets. Here, `lhs` refers to the left-hand side of the 'in' keyword in a 'for-in' loop. 

In the `Token.FOR` case within the switch statement, we could add something like:

```java
if (NodeUtil.isArrayElement(lhs)) {
    addToSetIfLocal(lhs.getFirstChild(), gen); // add array variable to gen set
    addToSetIfLocal(lhs.getFirstChild(), kill); // add array variable to kill set
}
```

This new condition checks whether the `lhs` node represents an array element. If it does, we add the array variable (`a` in `a[1]`) to the 'gen' and 'kill' sets. Please note that the `isArrayElement()` method and the logic to get the array variable might need to be implemented as per your codebase.
