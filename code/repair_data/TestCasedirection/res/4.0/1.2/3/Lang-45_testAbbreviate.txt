Intent: The purpose of the code is to abbreviate the input string based on given lower and upper boundaries and then append a provided string to the end. If the lower boundary is greater than the length of the string, it is set to the length of the string. If the upper boundary is -1 (no limit) or greater than the length of the string, it is also set to the length of the string. The code then finds the first occurrence of space from the lower limit and if it is greater than the upper limit, it abbreviates the string to the upper limit. If the index of the space is within the boundaries, it abbreviates to the first space. If no space is found, it abbreviates to the upper limit.

Fix strategy: The test case `assertEquals("0123456789", WordUtils.abbreviate("0123456789", 15, 20, null));` is failing because the lower limit provided is greater than the length of the string. According to the code logic, the string should be abbreviated to its length, which is "0123456789". However, it seems like the code is not handling this case properly. 

To fix this issue, we need to add a condition in the code to handle the scenario where the lower limit is greater than the length of the string. If the lower limit is greater than the length of the string, the function should return the original string. Here's the revised code:

```
if (lower > str.length()) {
    return str;
}
```

This condition should be checked at the beginning of the function, right after the initial parameter checks.
