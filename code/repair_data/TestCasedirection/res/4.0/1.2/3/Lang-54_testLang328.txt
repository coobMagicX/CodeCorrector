Intent: The intent of this source code is to convert a string representation of a locale into an instance of Locale. The string format should be either two characters representing the language, five characters representing language and country (separated by an underscore), or more than six characters representing language, country and variant (separated by two underscores).

Fix strategy: The issue with the code is that it doesn't handle the case where the input string format is "language__variant" properly. It expects that after the first underscore, there should be two uppercase letters representing the country, but in this case, there's no country, only a variant. 

To fix this, we can modify the code to handle this specific case. Specifically, if the string length is more than two and the third character is an underscore, we should check if the fourth character is also an underscore. If it is, then we should understand that there's no country and treat the rest of the string as a variant. If the fourth character is not an underscore, we can continue with the existing logic to treat the next two characters as country and the rest as variant (if exists).
