Intent: The purpose of the function evaluatesToLocalValue is to check whether a value is local or not based on its type. The function takes a Node value and a Predicate parameter. The function uses a switch statement to check the type of the node and depending on the type of the node, the function applies different logic to determine whether the value is local or not.

Fix strategy: The test case failed at line "assertFalse(testLocalValue("new x()"));". The function is currently returning true for Token.NEW, which is incorrect according to the test case. The function should not assume a new object to be local unless it is certain that they don't alias themselves. 

To fix this, we need to implement a check to ensure that new objects do not alias themselves. The check can be included in the case for Token.NEW in the switch statement. If the new object does not alias itself, the function should return true; otherwise, it should return false. 

Moreover, to avoid future issues, the node types that are not covered in the switch case should throw an exception indicating that the specific node type is not handled.
