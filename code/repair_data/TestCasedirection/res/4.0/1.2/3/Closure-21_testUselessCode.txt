Intent: The purpose of this source code is to visit nodes in a syntax tree and conduct checks to identify instances of code that lack side effects, which may indicate bugs. If such code is found, an error message is reported. The function handles different types of nodes (e.g., blocks, expressions, or names with attached JSDoc information) and evaluates whether their results are used or whether they may have side effects. 

Fix strategy: The failure occurs on the line where a variable is assigned a value that is a comma-separated sequence of expressions. The test case "var a, b; a = (bar(), 6, 7)" fails because the code does not correctly handle this scenario. The code currently returns early when the node's parent type is COMMA and the result is used. In this case, however, the result of the first expression "bar()" is not used, which should trigger an error. 

To fix this, the function should not return early when encountering a COMMA node, but instead continue to check each child node of the COMMA node separately. The for loop iterating over the ancestors of the current node should be removed. Instead, a new loop should iterate over all children of the COMMA node and apply the checks to each child separately.
