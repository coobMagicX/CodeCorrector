Intent: The purpose of the source code is to handle object literals in a Javascript code represented as a NodeTraversal and Node. It iterates through every child node and retrieves the property type. If the property has a scheduled renaming, it will proceed, else it will report an error if the property name is in the propertiesToErrorFor map. The failing test case 'testOneType4' is intended to validate the handling of object literals for a specific type.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs at 'testSets(false, js, js, expected);'. This suggests that the issue could be with the testSets function or the parameters being passed to it. Look into the 'testSets' method implementation and check the parameters being passed. It's possible that there's an issue with the input Javascript code 'js' or the expected outcome. Ensure that the 'js' string is a valid Javascript code and 'expected' string is the correct expected output. If the fault is from the 'testSets' method, debug it to fix the error. Additionally, ensure that the handleObjectLit method correctly handles the properties and their renaming.
