Intent: The intent of this code is to check if a given string is a simple number or not. It iterates over each character in the string to check whether it's a digit (between '0' and '9') and also checks if the string is not empty and does not start with '0'.

Fix strategy: The failed test case does not correspond to the provided source code. It seems like the test case is meant for a JavaScript minifier or pretty printer and not for the function `isSimpleNumber()`. Hence, we can't derive a fix strategy based on the provided information. It's recommended to use/write a test case that corresponds to the `isSimpleNumber()` function. For example:

```java
public void testIsSimpleNumber() {
  assertTrue(isSimpleNumber("123"));
  assertFalse(isSimpleNumber("012"));
  assertFalse(isSimpleNumber("12a"));
}
```
This would correctly test whether or not the function can identify simple numbers.
