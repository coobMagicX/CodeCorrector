Intent: The purpose of this code is to determine if a specific CharSequence contains any characters from a given array of characters. If it does, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This method is also meant to handle supplementary characters properly.

Fix strategy: The failing test case indicates that this method isn't correctly handling supplementary characters. In Unicode, supplementary characters are represented by a pair of char values. The current code treats these char values separately, which leads to false results.

To fix this, you need to update the method to correctly handle supplementary characters. You can do this by checking if each char is part of a supplementary character, and if so, combining it with the next char value to form the complete character before comparing it with the searchChars array.

Here's a sketch of how you could update the method:

```
public static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {
	if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {
		return false;
	}
	int csLength = cs.length();
	int searchLength = searchChars.length;
	for (int i = 0; i < csLength; i++) {
		char ch = cs.charAt(i);
		if (Character.isHighSurrogate(ch) && i < csLength - 1) {
			// Combine the high and low surrogates to form the complete character.
			ch = Character.toCodePoint(ch, cs.charAt(i + 1));
		}
		for (int j = 0; j < searchLength; j++) {
			if (searchChars[j] == ch) {
				// ch is in the Basic Multilingual Plane or is a supplementary character
				return true;
			}
		}
	}
	return false;
}
```

This updated method correctly handles both BMP and supplementary characters, so it should pass all the test cases.
