Intent: The purpose of the code is to check if a variable in a JavaScript code is read before it is reassigned (killed). The function traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the JavaScript code, visiting each node. When it encounters a node where the variable is being assigned a value, it returns "KILL". If the variable is being read, it returns "READ". If neither is the case, it traverses further into the tree. If it doesn't find any assignment or read operation on the variable, it returns "MAYBE_LIVE".

Fix strategy: The failing test case suggests that the function is not correctly handling the situation where a variable is reassigned while being used in an expression. The code needs to be modified to correctly identify and handle such instances. This might involve checking for the situation where the variable is being read and assigned within the same expression, and returning "READ" in such cases.

The following modification to the code should fix the problem. 

```java
 if (NodeUtil.isName(n) && variable.equals(n.getString())) {
    if (NodeUtil.isLhs(n, n.getParent())) {
      Node grandparent = n.getParent().getParent();
      if (NodeUtil.isExpression(grandparent) && NodeUtil.isAssignment(grandparent.getFirstChild())) {
        return VariableLiveness.READ;
      } else {
        return VariableLiveness.KILL;
      }
    } else {
      return VariableLiveness.READ;
    }
  }
```

This additional condition checks if the current node is part of an assignment expression. If it is, the function returns "READ". Otherwise, the function proceeds as before.
