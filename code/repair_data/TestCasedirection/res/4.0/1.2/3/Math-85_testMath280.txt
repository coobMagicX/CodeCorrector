Intent: The intent of this source code is to bracket a root for a given univariate real function within a specified range (defined by a lower and an upper bound) and a maximum number of iterations. It validates the input parameters and then uses a do-while loop to iteratively adjust the boundaries a and b. It throws an exception if it is unable to find a bracket (i.e., a range where the function changes sign) within the given constraints.

The failed test case is testing the NormalDistribution's inverseCumulativeProbability method. This function should return a quantile for a given probability, which in this case should be 2.0 for the probability 0.9772498680518209. 

Fix strategy: The error seems to be occurring in the method inverseCumulativeProbability(). Hence, the problem is likely not in the bracket method, but rather in the inverseCumulativeProbability() method. The failing line is not directly related to the bracket method, so the issue is likely with the NormalDistributionImpl class or the inverseCumulativeProbability method itself. 

To fix the issue, the inverseCumulativeProbability method should be examined and debugged to ensure it is correctly calculating the inverse cumulative probability for a given input. This could involve checking the mathematical logic within the method, ensuring that the method is correctly handling edge cases, and verifying that the input parameters are being correctly processed. After the necessary corrections are identified, the method should be updated accordingly, and the test case should be run again to confirm the fix.
