Intent: The purpose of the source code is to check if a given node, `n`, is a function expression. This is a simple utility function that could be used for various purposes such as code analysis, optimization, or transformations.

The failing test case `testIssue538` is trying to check if a given JavaScript code block, which defines a constructor function and a prototype object with several getter methods, compiles to the same output. The `checkCompilesToSame` function is likely to be testing if the generated code from the compiler has the same semantics as the input code.

Fix Strategy: The failure seems to occur at the `checkCompilesToSame` method. This indicates that the compiler might not be generating the expected output for the given input code. The issue could be due to the compiler not properly handling JavaScript getter methods. A possible fix would be to update the compiler to correctly parse and generate code for JavaScript getter methods. 

Additionally, the source code `isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n)` is not directly involved in the failure according to the provided information. If there is a need to check function expressions within the tested JavaScript code, then we should ensure that `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)` is able to correctly identify and handle getter methods as function expressions.
