Intent: The intent of this source code is to add a specific value to a given field (e.g., month, day, year) in a date. The code takes into account the continuity and discontinuity of the date's fields, and handles leap year scenarios where adding months to February 29th could lead to invalid dates.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs when subtracting months from a leap day (February 29). The logic for adding or subtracting months in the case of a leap year seems to be missing or incorrect. A fix strategy would be to add specific logic to handle leap years. Check if the original date is February 29 of a leap year, and if so, adjust the resulting date to the last valid day of February in non-leap years when subtracting months leads to a non-leap year.
