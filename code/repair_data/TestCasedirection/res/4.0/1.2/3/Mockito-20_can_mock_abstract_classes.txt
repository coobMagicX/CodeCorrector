Intent: The purpose of the source code is to generate a mock object based on provided settings and handler. The mock object is used for testing purposes, in particular, to isolate the behavior of a class or method. This code is a part of a Mocking Library, likely Mockito, used for unit testing in Java. The failed test case is attempting to mock an abstract class and expecting the mocked object to return a specific message.

Fix strategy: The failure is occurring on the assertion line, suggesting that the mocked object isn't returning the expected output. This could be due to an issue with the mock creation process, or the abstract class implementation. 

1. Check the implementation of the `getMessage()` method in the `AbstractMessage` class to ensure it correctly returns "hey!" when called.
2. If the method is correct, the issue might be with the mock creation. Trace the mock creation process in the `createMock()` method to ensure the mock instance is correctly created and the MockMethodInterceptor is correctly set.
3. If the mock creation is correct, the problem might be with the `useConstructor().defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS)`. This setting means that when an unstubbed method is called on the mock object, the real underlying method is called instead. Make sure that the real method is correctly implemented and can be correctly invoked.
4. If the problem persists, consider stubbing the `getMessage()` method directly to return "hey!". This can help isolate whether the problem is with the mocking of the method or elsewhere.
