Intent: The function `getReadableJSTypeName()` is used to get a human-readable name of a JavaScript type. It deals with different types of JavaScript objects and handles them according to their properties and functions. The failed test case `testIssue1047()` is testing the behavior of the function when a property is not defined on a constructor function.

Fix strategy: The test case failed because it's trying to access a property `prop` that was never defined on `C2`. There are two possible solutions:
1. Define the property `prop` on `C2`. This way, when the property is accessed, it will not result in an error.
2. Update the function `getReadableJSTypeName()` to handle the case when a property is not defined. This could involve adding a null or undefined check before accessing the property. If the property is undefined, the function could return a default value or throw a specific error.
