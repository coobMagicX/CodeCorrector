Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the percentage value of a fraction. The test case is designed to check the calculation when the fraction is made up of large numbers, specifically the maximum integer value divided by 99.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be an overflow problem when calculating the percentage value with large numbers. The current implementation is multiplying the fraction by 100 and then converting it to a double. A potential fix would be to convert the fraction to a double first, and then multiply by 100. This should help prevent the overflow issue. 

Here's the modified source code:
```java
public double percentageValue() {
    return this.doubleValue() * 100;
}
```
The test case should pass now without causing an overflow error.
