Intent: The intent of the source code is to fetch the remaining part of a JSDoc comment line from a stream. The purpose of the failing test case is to validate the correct parsing of JSDoc comments, especially those containing type annotations.

Fix strategy: Based on the error message, it seems like there is a problem in parsing the type annotation in JSDoc comments. The parsing logic needs to be reviewed and fixed. Specifically, the parsing of "{@code foo}" seems to be causing an issue. The parser should be able to correctly interpret this part as a type annotation. There might be a need to update the regular expression or the parsing rule associated with it.
