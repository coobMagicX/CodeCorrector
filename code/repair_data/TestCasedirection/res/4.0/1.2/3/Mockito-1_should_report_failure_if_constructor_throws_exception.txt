Intent: The purpose of the source code is to capture arguments from an invocation. If the method is a variable argument method, it throws an UnsupportedOperationException. Otherwise, it iterates through a list of matchers, and if a matcher is an instance of CapturesArguments, it captures the argument from the invocation at the respective position. It also handles the case where the argument is a variable argument and the matcher is a vararg matcher. In this case, it captures all variable arguments and ends the process.

The failed test case is intended to check if a failure is reported when a constructor throws an exception. It mocks a resolver to return null when resolving type instances and attempts to instantiate a ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator. If the instantiation does not throw a MockitoException, the test fails. If it does, it checks if the exception message contains the words "constructor" and "raised an exception".

Fix strategy: The failure could be due to the fact that the constructor throws an exception, which is not handled in the source code. We might need to modify the source code to handle exceptions during the instantiation of objects. This could be done by wrapping the instantiation in a try-catch block and handling the exception appropriately. Alternatively, the test might be failing because the resolver is returning null. We need to ensure the resolver returns valid type instances.
