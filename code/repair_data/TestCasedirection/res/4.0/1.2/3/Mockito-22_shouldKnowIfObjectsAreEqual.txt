Intent: The purpose of the source code is to compare two objects and return true if they are equal and false if they are not. The function is meant to handle both arrays and non-array objects. It is also designed to correctly handle null values. The failed test case shows that the function does not handle objects with improper equals() implementation correctly.

Fix strategy: The problem seems to lie in the usage of the equals() method. Some classes may have an improper equals() method which could cause undesired results when it's called. It's possible that the class of 'badequals' object has an incorrectly implemented equals() method. To fix this, we can't really change the areEqual function if we do not have control over the equals() method of the objects being compared. It would be best to ensure that the equals() method of the objects being compared are correctly implemented. It would be also helpful to add a null check before calling equals() method. If we can't ensure that, we can add a try-catch block to catch any exception thrown by equals() method and return false in such case.
