Intent: The purpose of the source code is to remove unreferenced function arguments from the scope of a function. This function takes into account whether the function is a getter/setter, and whether the function can be modified at call sites. It also handles the removal of unreferenced arguments from the end of the function declaration.

Fix strategy: The failed test case suggests that the function isn't correctly handling nested functions. It seems like the function 'y' is being modified even though 'removeGlobal' is set to 'false'. A possible fix would be to add a check to ensure that 'removeGlobal' is 'true' before modifying a function. Additionally, you should also check if 'y' is a global function before attempting to modify it. If it's not global and 'removeGlobal' is 'false', the function 'y' should remain unmodified.
