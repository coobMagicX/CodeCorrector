Intent: The purpose of the source code is to implement an integrator for systems of first order differential equations using the Adams-Moulton method. It accepts a test problem and tries to solve it within a certain range. It then adds a step handler to the integrator to handle the steps of the integration and finally integrates the test problem. The failing test case is checking whether the number of evaluations for the integrator is less than 90 when the number of steps is 4 or more.

Fix strategy: The error might be due to the number of evaluations exceeding 90 for the given inputs. It can be fixed by either optimizing the integrator's performance to reduce the number of evaluations required or by adjusting the input parameters in a way that they require fewer evaluations. Also, consider revising the assertTrue condition or the expected number of evaluations if the current expectation is not practical or incorrect.
