Intent: The purpose of the source code is to convert a string into a Locale object. The string is expected to follow a specific format (ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code, and optional variant codes). The code checks the format of the input string and throws an exception if it's invalid. The failed test case is testing whether the function can handle input strings that start with an underscore and follow a specific format described in the test cases.

Fix strategy: The source code fails to handle cases where the string starts with an underscore. The code should be modified to accept these cases. Specifically, when the string starts with an underscore, the function should accept two uppercase characters as valid input. If there's anything after those two characters, it should be preceded by another underscore. The function should be modified to check whether the string starts with an underscore and handle this case separately.
