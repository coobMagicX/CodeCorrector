Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to create a Fraction object from a given double value. It uses the method of continued fractions to approximate the double value as a fraction, within a certain error tolerance (epsilon). The constructor throws a FractionConversionException if it cannot convert the value within the provided maximum number of iterations or if the numerator or denominator exceeds the maximum integer value. 

The failed test case is designed to test the constructor's ability to handle large negative numbers and to throw a FractionConversionException when overflow occurs.

Fix Strategy: The failure seems to be occurring because the check for overflow is not properly accounting for negative numbers. The line "if ((p2 > overflow) || (q2 > overflow))" only checks if p2 or q2 are greater than the maximum integer value, but it does not check if they are less than the minimum integer value. 

You can modify the overflow check to also consider negative overflow. This can be done by adding a condition that checks if p2 or q2 is less than Integer.MIN_VALUE. Here's how the modified code might look:

"if ((p2 > overflow) || (q2 > overflow) || (p2 < Integer.MIN_VALUE) || (q2 < Integer.MIN_VALUE))".

This modification should handle integer overflow for both positive and negative numbers correctly, and allow the test case to pass.
