Intent: The purpose of the source code is to process ForInLoop nodes in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It transforms each part of the ForInLoop node (Iterator, IteratedObject, and Body) into a new node structure. 

The failed test case is trying to parse and validate a function that uses "for each" loop which is an unsupported language extension in the source code. 

Fix strategy: The source code does not support the "for each" loop construct. To fix this, you could either change the test case to use a supported loop construct such as a simple "for" loop, or modify the source code to support "for each" loops. 

For the latter, you will need to add a new case in your AST transformation function to handle "for each" loops. You may need to create a new node type for "for each" loops or modify the existing ForInLoop node type to accommodate the "for each" syntax. 

You will also need to add error handling code in the parseError function to handle "unsupported language extension: for each" errors differently, probably by providing a more detailed error message or by throwing a different type of exception.
