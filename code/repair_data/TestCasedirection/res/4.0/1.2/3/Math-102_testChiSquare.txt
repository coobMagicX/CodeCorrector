Intent: The purpose of the code is to calculate the chi-square statistic of the observed and expected arrays. The chi-square test is a statistical hypothesis test that assumes the observed frequencies for a categorical variable match the expected frequencies for the categorical variable. The code also checks if the input arrays meet certain conditions: they must have the same length, the expected values must be positive, and the observed values must be non-negative.

Fix strategy: The failed test case shows that the calculated chi-square test statistic does not match the expected value. The issue might be due to the precision of the floating point calculation. A common solution for this would be to adjust the precision in the assertEquals method, but in this case, the precision is already quite high (1E-10). Another possibility is that there could be an error in the calculation of the chi-square statistic. Check the formula used in the chiSquare() method, specifically the line where 'sumSq' is calculated. Ensure the formula is implemented correctly as per the chi-square calculation formula, which is sum((observed - expected)^2 / expected). Also, consider edge cases where division by zero might occur.
