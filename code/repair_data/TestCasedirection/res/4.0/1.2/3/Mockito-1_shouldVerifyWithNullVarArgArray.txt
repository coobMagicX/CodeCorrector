Intent: The purpose of the source code is to capture arguments from an invocation, specifically handling cases where the invoked method has variable arguments (varargs). The captured arguments are then used by matchers for verification purposes. The failing test case is attempting to verify a method that accepts variable arguments, but in this case, the argument is null.

Fix strategy: The UnsupportedOperationException is thrown if the method being invoked is a varargs method. This exception is thrown without any condition, which is likely causing the issue. The solution would be to handle this case properly. If the method is a varargs method and the argument is null, we should not throw an exception. Instead, we should capture a null argument. This would entail modifying the if block to capture null arguments and only throw an exception if the argument is not null and is not an instance of an array.
