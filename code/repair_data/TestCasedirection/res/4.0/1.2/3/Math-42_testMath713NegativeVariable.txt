Intent: The intent of the source code is to solve linear equations using the Simplex algorithm. It determines the coefficients of the variables in the equation that would satisfy the constraints and would either maximize or minimize the objective function.

The test case `testMath713NegativeVariable` is specifically intended to check if the method can handle situations where the variable in the constraint is negative. It asserts that the result of the optimization problem should be a non-negative value.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs at the line where the test asserts that the second coefficient solution (index 1) from the SimplexSolver should be non-negative. The issue might be that the SimplexSolver is not correctly handling the constraints when the variable is negative.

The bug might be in the `getSolution()` method in the source code, where the coefficients for the variables are calculated. The logic for handling negative variables might be incorrect.

A fix strategy could be to review and debug the logic in the `getSolution()` method where the coefficients for the variables are calculated. An extra check for negative variables can be added. If a variable is negative, then the code should handle it differently to ensure that the final result of the variable is non-negative as required.
