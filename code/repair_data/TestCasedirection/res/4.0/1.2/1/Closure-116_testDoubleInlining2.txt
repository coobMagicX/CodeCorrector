Intent: The intent of this code is to check if a function can be inlined directly. It performs checks on the function node and the call node to determine if the function can be inlined. The function is considered inline-able if it passes certain conditions such as not affecting mutable state, not having side effects, and matching the parameter list of the call node.

Fix strategy: The test case `testDoubleInlining2` fails because the function `foo` cannot be inlined directly due to its dependency on another function `bar`. The function `foo` is dependent on the return value of function `bar` and hence cannot be inlined directly. The test case assumes that the function `foo` can be inlined directly which is incorrect. 

To fix this test case, the function `foo` should be modified such that it is not dependent on the return value of any other function and the test case should be updated accordingly. Also, the function `bar` should be called separately before inlining `foo`. This way, the function `foo` can be inlined directly and the test case should pass.
