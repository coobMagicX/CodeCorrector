Intent: The intent of the source code is to calculate the offset from local time, considering Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. The code is supposed to adjust the given local time to its corresponding DST and return the appropriate offset. The failing test case is trying to test whether this function works properly during the DST transition in Moscow in autumn, specifically for each minute within an hour.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs when the 'min' variable is less than 10 in the test case. The issue might be related to the formatting of the time string with the leading zero for minutes less than 10. The function 'doTest_getOffsetFromLocal' seems not to handle this format correctly. To fix this, I would recommend checking the implementation of 'doTest_getOffsetFromLocal' to ensure it handles time strings with leading zeros correctly. If not, modify 'doTest_getOffsetFromLocal' to correctly interpret time strings with leading zeros. Also, consider adding additional test cases to verify the correct handling of time strings with leading zero minutes.
