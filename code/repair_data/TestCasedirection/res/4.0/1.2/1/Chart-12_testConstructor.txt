Intent: The intent of this code is to create a constructor for a MultiplePiePlot class that takes a CategoryDataset as a parameter. It sets up a PiePlot and JFreeChart, removes the legend, sets the background to null, and creates a title for the series. It also sets up some properties for aggregated items and section paints. The test case is intended to verify that the constructor behaves as expected by asserting that a newly created plot has null dataset, and that a plot created with a dataset registers itself as a listener with the dataset.

Fix strategy: From the failing test case, it seems like the MultiplePiePlot constructor is not adding itself as a listener to the dataset. The fix would be to modify the constructor of MultiplePiePlot class to register the plot as a dataset listener. This can be done by calling the addChangeListener method on the dataset object, passing the current instance (this) as an argument.
