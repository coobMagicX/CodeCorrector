Intent: The purpose of the given source code is to calculate the follow node in a Control Flow Graph (CFG). It is responsible for transferring control to the right node based on the type of the parent node and the current node. The code also handles special cases for different kinds of nodes such as `IF`, `CASE`, `FOR`, `WHILE`, `DO`, `TRY`, and others in the CFG.

The failed test case is trying to verify the correctness of the control flow when there's a deep nesting of `try`, `finally`, and `while` blocks with a `break` statement. The failed assertion is checking that there is a correct control flow from one `BLOCK` to another on exception (`ON_EX`).

Fix strategy: The fix strategy should involve debugging the `computeFollowNode` function to ensure that it correctly calculates the follow node when encountering `try`, `finally`, and `break` statements. More specifically, the control flow in the presence of `finally` blocks and `break` statements needs to be correctly handled. Examine the logic for handling `TRY` tokens in the switch case, ensure that the code correctly handles the different possibilities and transfers control to the appropriate nodes. Also, check the creation of edges in the CFG, particularly in the scenario of exceptions (`Branch.ON_EX`).
