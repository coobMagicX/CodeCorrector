Intent: The purpose of the source code is to find the first row in a matrix (from getNumObjectiveFunctions() to getHeight()) that has a non-zero entry for a given column. If more than one such row is found, it returns null. The failed test case is meant to test the optimization of a linear equation with a single variable and constraint through the SimplexSolver.

Fix strategy: The test case failure at "assertEquals(10.0, solution.getPoint()[0], 0.0);" suggests that the solution point does not match the expected value of 10.0. This could be due to the 'getBasicRow' method not correctly identifying the row from the matrix. There might be two or more rows in the matrix with non-zero entries for a given column, causing the method to return null. The fix strategy could be to revise the 'getBasicRow' method to handle multiple rows with non-zero entries in a way that aligns with the requirements of the SimplexSolver. Possible alternatives could be to return the first row found or a collection of all rows found, depending on the underlying mathematical model.
