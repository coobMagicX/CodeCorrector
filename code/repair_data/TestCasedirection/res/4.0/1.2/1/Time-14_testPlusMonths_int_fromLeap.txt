Intent: The intent of the source code is to add a specified number of months to a given date. It is intended to handle leap year dates (like 29th February), as well as dates from non-leap years. The failed test case is checking if the function correctly adds one month to a leap day (29th February) to result in 29th March.

Fix strategy: The issue seems to be with the handling of leap year dates when a month is added. The fix strategy would be to add an additional check in the 'add' function to accurately handle the increment of the month in a leap year scenario. An alternative approach would be to use an existing date-time library or function that accurately handles leap years when adding months to a date.
