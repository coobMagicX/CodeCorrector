Intent: The intent of the source code is to convert a list of objects into a PeriodFormatter, which is a class for printing and parsing period strings in Joda-Time library. The code takes into consideration whether the PeriodFormatter should be a printer, a parser, or both. The test case is meant to construct two PeriodFormatters using different methods and parse the same period string.

Fix strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that the second formatter (pfmt2) is not able to correctly parse the provided string "PT1003199059S". This could be due to the fact that the second formatter is constructed using the `ISOPeriodFormat.standard()`, which may not support the format of the provided string. 

The fix strategy would be to ensure that the period format used to build the formatter is compatible with the period string to be parsed. Instead of using `ISOPeriodFormat.standard()`, the same literal format used to build `pfmt1` should be used to build `pfmt2`. If there are reasons to use different formats for different formatters, then ensure that the period string to be parsed matches the format of the formatter.
