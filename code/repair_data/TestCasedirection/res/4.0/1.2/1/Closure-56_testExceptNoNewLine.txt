Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to get a specific line from a given string (which could represent a file or document). The function takes in the line number as parameter and returns the content of the line. If the line number does not exist in the source string or if there is any exception, it returns null.

Fix strategy: The problem lies in the handling of the case where no newline character ('\n') is found in the string. When the last line of the string does not end with a newline character, the function incorrectly returns null. The fix would be to check if the position has reached the end of the string, and if not, return the contents between the current position and the end of the string.

Here's the fix:

```java
if (js.indexOf('\n', pos) == -1) {
    if (pos >= js.length()) {
        return null;
    } else {
        return js.substring(pos, js.length());
    }
} else {
    return js.substring(pos, js.indexOf('\n', pos));
}
```
This fix checks if the position 'pos' has reached or exceeded the length of the string 'js'. If it has, it is the end of the file and should return null. If not, it should return the remaining content from the position 'pos' to the end of the string.
