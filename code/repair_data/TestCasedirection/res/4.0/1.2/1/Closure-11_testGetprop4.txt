Intent: The purpose of the source code is to check property access in JavaScript objects. It ensures that the properties or methods accessed are legitimate and follows the structure of the object. It validates properties access, checks if the property access is on a dictionary object, and also checks for null or undefined properties.

Fix strategy: The failed test case indicates that the code is trying to access a property on a null object, which is not allowed. You can add a null check before accessing the property. Additionally, you should provide a more descriptive error message to inform the user that they are trying to access a property on a null object. The fix should look like this:

```java
if (objNode == null) {
  report(t, property, TypeValidator.ILLEGAL_PROPERTY_ACCESS, "'.'", "null");
} else if (childType.isDict()) {
  report(t, property, TypeValidator.ILLEGAL_PROPERTY_ACCESS, "'.'", "dict");
} else if (n.getJSType() != null && parent.isAssign()) {
  return;
} else if (validator.expectNotNullOrUndefined(t, n, childType,
  "No properties on this expression", getNativeType(OBJECT_TYPE))) {
  checkPropertyAccess(childType, property.getString(), t, n);
}
ensureTyped(t, n);
```
This fix will check if the object node is null and report an error before trying to access its properties. If the object node is not null, then the existing checks are performed.
