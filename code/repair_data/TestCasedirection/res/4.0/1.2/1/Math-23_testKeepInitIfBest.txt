Intent: The intent of this code is to implement the Brent's optimization algorithm to find the extremum (either minimum or maximum) of a univariate function. It is part of a class that contains an optimization method to be used in mathematical or statistical computation. The purpose of the failed test case is to check whether the optimizer correctly identifies the minimum value of a function. 

Fix strategy: The assertion fails because the actual best point found by the optimizer is expected to be less than or equal to the expected best point, but it is not. This could be due to the precision error in the optimizer or due to the stringent relative tolerance given. Fixing this issue could involve adjusting the relative tolerance to a higher value which might make the optimizer to be more tolerant to small differences. Moreover, it might be necessary to adjust the initial starting point for optimization as it might not be the best starting point to find the global minimum. 

Another possible fix strategy could be to investigate if the computeObjectiveValue() method returns the correct value or not. If it is not correctly implemented, it may cause the optimizer to find an incorrect minimum value. This method should be thoroughly tested and if it doesn't work as expected, it should be fixed.
