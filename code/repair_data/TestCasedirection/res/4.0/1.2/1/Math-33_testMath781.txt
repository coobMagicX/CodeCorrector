Intent: The purpose of the provided source code is to optimize a linear objective function under a set of constraints. The function works by dropping the phase 1 objective, which means it removes variables that don't fulfill certain conditions (e.g. variables with positive cost or non-basic artificial variables). If a variable doesn't meet these conditions, it is removed from the matrix.

The failed test case (testMath781) is intended to solve a linear programming problem using the Simplex method. It checks whether the solution of the problem meets certain conditions.

Fix strategy: The failure is occurring on the line where it's asserting that the first coordinate of the solution point is greater than zero. This indicates that the solution produced by the algorithm isn't meeting the expected conditions. This suggests that there could be an issue with the way variables are dropped in the 'dropPhase1Objective' function. 

To fix this, you may need to review and revise the conditions under which variables are dropped from the matrix. Ensure that these conditions correctly implement the logic of the Simplex method. Check also the way the matrix is rebuilt after dropping the variables, as this could be another source of errors. 

Additionally, make sure that the problem constraints are being correctly set up in the test case. The issue might not be in the function itself, but in the data it's being tested with.
