Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture arguments from a method invocation for mock testing. It handles two cases - when the method has variable arguments (varargs) and when it doesn't. In the case of varargs, arguments are captured one by one. In the non-varargs case, arguments are captured based on their position. The failed test case is trying to verify a method with boolean variable arguments.

Fix strategy: The failure occurred at the line where the method 'withBooleanVarargs' is verified with a single argument. This indicates that the code is not handling the case when varargs method is invoked with a single argument correctly. The exception 'UnsupportedOperationException' is thrown whenever a varargs method is invoked, which explains why the test case failed.

The fix should involve handling the case when a varargs method is invoked with a single argument. One possible fix would be to remove the 'UnsupportedOperationException'. Instead, when the 'isVarArgs()' method returns true, the code should capture the single variable argument just like it does for multiple variable arguments. An additional check might be needed to ensure that 'indexOfVararg' is not negative, which would indicate that no arguments were passed.
