Intent: The intent of the source code is to determine whether a value (node) evaluates to a local value or not. It's a function that analyses the node type and based on the type, it checks different conditions to infer if the value is local or not. The test case which is failing is intended to verify that returning a local object which has been modified is not a global side-effect.

Fix Strategy: The failure is occurring because the function `evaluatesToLocalValue` is not handling the scenario where a local object is modified and then returned hence not accounting for a global side-effect. The fix would involve modifying this function to account for this scenario. Specifically, in the switch-case block, a case for `Token.NEW` is needed where it should check if the new object is modified thereafter, and if yes, it should return that it's still a local value. This can be achieved by tracking the state of the object after it's created and before it's returned.
