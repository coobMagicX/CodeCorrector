Intent: The purpose of the code is to parse a string input into a fraction. It first attempts to parse the string into an improper fraction. If that fails, it parses the string into a whole number, a numerator, and a denominator separated by a slash (/). It also handles whitespace and checks for invalid input. For example, it fails if it finds a minus sign that isn't leading in the fraction.

Fix strategy: The test cases fail when a minus sign is found in the improper fraction that isn't at the beginning. The parsing code should be updated to handle this scenario. One possible fix could be to modify the code to detect a minus sign in the numerator or denominator and flag it as invalid input. This could be achieved by adding an additional check after parsing the numerator and denominator. If a minus sign is detected that isn't at the beginning, the code should set the index back to initial, set the error index, and return null.
