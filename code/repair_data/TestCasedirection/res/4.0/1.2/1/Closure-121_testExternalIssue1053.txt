Intent: The purpose of this code is to inline non-constants. It checks if a variable is immutable and well-defined, and if it is, the variable is inlined. It also tries more complex inlining heuristics if the variable is only read once. If a variable is not properly inlined, this code checks if we can inline an alias of it.

Fix strategy: From the failed test case, it appears that the code fails when attempting to inline a variable that is not immutable (as it is assigned a new value at each function call). To fix this issue, additional checks should be added to ensure a variable is not inlined if it's reassigned within the function body. Alternatively, you could add a condition check to avoid inlining variables whose values are functions that can return different values at each call, such as Random().
