Intent: The intent of the source code is to capture the arguments from a method invocation and store them using matchers. It is designed to handle both standard arguments and variable arguments (varargs). The failed test case is intended to verify the behavior of different methods under various conditions using matchers and stubs, and assert the expected outcome of a method call. 

Fix strategy: The failure comes from the assertion `assertEquals("stubbed", three.varargsObject(5, "first arg", "second arg"))`. The expected return value is "stubbed" but the actual return value seems to be something else. This could be because of incorrect stubbing or the method `varargsObject` not working as expected. Check the following:

1. Ensure the `varargsObject` method has been correctly implemented and works as expected.
2. The stubbing of the `varargsObject` method needs to be checked. Ensure that `when(three.varargsObject(5, "first arg", "second arg")).thenReturn("stubbed")` is properly stubbing the method to return "stubbed".
3. If the above two points are correct, then the error could come from the `captureArgumentsFrom` method in the source code, especially the treatment of varargs. This method might not be correctly capturing the arguments from the `varargsObject` method invocation, causing it to return an unexpected value. Check the way varargs are handled in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method.
