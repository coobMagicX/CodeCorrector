Intent: The test testStructuralConstructor3 aims to validate that the parser accurately interprets and resolves a JSDoc type annotation describing a function that serves as a constructor (function(new:*)). The purpose is to ensure the parser can handle complex type expressions that involve constructors, correctly interpreting them as functions that instantiate object types.

Repair strategy: Modify the parseContextTypeExpression method to improve the handling of constructor type expressions and potentially other complex type constructs. The change involves replacing the parseTypeName function with parseBasicTypeExpression, suggesting that parseBasicTypeExpression is better equipped to handle complex type annotations like constructors. This change should allow for a more accurate parsing of constructor semantics, ensuring that expressions involving 'new:' are parsed as types that denote object creation, thus aligning with the expectations set by the test case. Additionally, ensure that the method for creating new nodes (newNode) correctly reflects the token parsed, enhancing the robustness of the parsing mechanism.
