Intent: The purpose of the source code is to capture arguments from a given invocation. If the method of the invocation contains variable arguments (varargs), the code is supposed to throw an UnsupportedOperationException. For non-varargs methods, it iterates through the matchers, and if the matcher captures arguments, it captures from the arguments at the current position. Additionally, if the argument's length is greater than the current position and is a variable argument, it captures from the array of arguments. 

The failed test case, "shouldVerifyCorrectlyWithAnyVarargs", aims to verify that the newRow method in the table class is called exactly two times with any string and any number of variable string arguments.

Fix strategy: The failure occurs because the source code throws an UnsupportedOperationException when it encounters a method with varargs. This is contradictory to the test case where we expect the newRow method to handle varargs correctly. We need to modify the source code to correctly handle varargs rather than throwing an exception. 

The fix would involve writing a correct block of logic in the if (invocation.getMethod().isVarArgs()) {} section of the code to handle the variable arguments as intended, instead of throwing the UnsupportedOperationException. This would involve correctly capturing the arguments as is done in the else section of the code. 

Moreover, the test case could be failing due to the newRow method not correctly accepting variable length arguments. If this is the case, the newRow method would need to be adjusted to correctly accept and handle variable length arguments.
