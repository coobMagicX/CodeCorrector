Intent: The purpose of the function `shouldTraverse` is to determine whether or not to traverse a certain `Node n` within the source code, based on its type and its relationship with its parent node `Node parent` and the `NodeTraversal t`. It is used to skip certain nodes during the traversal, such as functions that are constructors or have the @this or @override annotation, or functions that would not normally be able to have a @this annotation associated with them. It also handles cases where the node is on the left or right side of an assignment and special cases where the assignment involves a prototype property or subproperty.

Fix strategy: The test is failing because the function `shouldTraverse` does not properly handle the case where the property name of a prototype is computed (i.e., it's not a fixed string, but a string expression). In this case, "a.prototype['x' + 'y']" is equivalent to "a.prototype.xy", but the current code does not account for this.

To fix this, update the condition where it checks for the prototype property. Specifically, instead of just checking if the last child is "prototype", also check if the string representation of the property key starts with "prototype". Also, instead of checking if `lhs.getQualifiedName().contains(".prototype.")`, check if `lhs.getQualifiedName().startsWith("prototype.")` or contains ".prototype.".

For example, the code could be updated as follows:

```java
if ((lhs.getType() == Token.GETPROP &&
     lhs.getLastChild().getString().startsWith("prototype")) ||
    (lhs.getQualifiedName() != null &&
     (lhs.getQualifiedName().startsWith("prototype.") ||
      lhs.getQualifiedName().contains(".prototype.")))) {
  return false;
}
```

This modification will ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the property name of a prototype is computed.
