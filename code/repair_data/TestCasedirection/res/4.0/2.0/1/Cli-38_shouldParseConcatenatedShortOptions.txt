Intent:
The test case `shouldParseConcatenatedShortOptions` is designed to verify that the command line parser correctly identifies and separates concatenated short options without values (e.g., `-ab` should be recognized as two separate options: `a` and `b`). It also checks that an option that includes a value immediately following it (e.g., `-t1`) should correctly parse `t` as the option and `1` as its value.

Repair strategy:
The source code needs to be adjusted to handle cases where multiple short options are concatenated without spaces between them, as well as handling options that have values directly attached to them. The current implementation does not seem to distinguish between concatenated short options and options that directly include their values. Enhancements should include:
- Modifying the `isShortOption` method to better parse and separate concatenated short options.
- Adjusting the method to correctly interpret and separate the option from its value when they are concatenated (e.g., `-t1` should be interpreted as option `t` with value `1`).
- Ensure proper handling of multiple concatenated options without values, parsing them as individual options instead of a single string.
