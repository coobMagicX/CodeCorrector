Intent: The test case `handlesControlCodeInAttributeName` aims to verify that the HTML parser correctly processes and ignores HTML attributes with names that include control characters. The intent is to ensure that the parser can handle and sanitize input containing such characters to prevent malformed HTML output.

Repair strategy: Improve the attribute name sanitization process in the attribute parsing and creation logic. Specifically, enhance the handling of attribute names containing control characters by either ignoring them completely or removing these characters before creating the attribute. This could involve modifying the `newAttribute` method to include a validation check that strips or validates control characters from `pendingAttributeName` before it is used to create an attribute. Adjust the logic to ensure that any attribute name containing invalid characters does not disrupt the parsing process and conforms to HTML standards.
