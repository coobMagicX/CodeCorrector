Intent: The test 'testNotAllowMultipleMatches' is designed to ensure that the JSON parsing and filtering mechanism correctly handles cases where multiple matches are not allowed. Specifically, it aims to verify that when the filter is set to match a single occurrence of a specific field name ("value" in this case), only the first match is considered, and subsequent matches are ignored.

Repair strategy: Inspect the filtering logic in the 'nextToken' method to ensure that once a match is found (and if multiple matches are disallowed), any further tokens with the same name are not considered as valid matches. This could include setting a flag after the first match is found or modifying the state of the filter to prevent further matches. Ensure that the logic correctly skips or ignores additional values associated with the same field name after the first occurrence is processed.
