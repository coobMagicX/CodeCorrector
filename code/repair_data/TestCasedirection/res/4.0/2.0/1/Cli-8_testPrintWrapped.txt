Intent: The intent of the `renderWrappedText` method is to wrap a given string `text` at a specified width and append the result to a `StringBuffer` `sb`. If `nextLineTabStop` is greater than zero, each line after the first should be padded with spaces equal to `nextLineTabStop`.

Repair strategy: The potential issue is likely related to incorrect padding application or incorrect calculation of the wrap position when padding is applied. The repair should focus on ensuring that the padding is correctly added to each subsequent line after wrapping and that `findWrapPos` accurately calculates the position considering the padding. This involves reviewing and possibly adjusting the logic in the `while` loop where `pos` is recalculated and text is appended to ensure padding is correctly factored into the wrap position calculation.
