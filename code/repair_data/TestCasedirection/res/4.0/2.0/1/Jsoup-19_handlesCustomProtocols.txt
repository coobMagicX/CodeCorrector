Intent:
The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the function `testValidProtocol` effectively handles custom protocols such as "cid" and "data" specified for image sources in HTML content. The test aims to ensure that these protocols are preserved when explicitly added to the Whitelist used by the `Jsoup.clean` method, as opposed to being dropped or altered.

Repair strategy:
To address the failure in the test case, the repair strategy should focus on ensuring that custom protocols specified in the Whitelist are recognized and retained by the `testValidProtocol` method. This might involve modifying the method to handle a wider array of protocols beyond common ones like "http," "https," etc. Additionally, the method should ensure that it checks for protocol presence in a case-insensitive manner and effectively preserves the original protocol in the attribute's value when `preserveRelativeLinks` is false. The logic within the loop that checks each protocol should be reviewed to confirm that it correctly identifies and validates protocols from the set provided, allowing for any custom protocols to pass through as valid.
