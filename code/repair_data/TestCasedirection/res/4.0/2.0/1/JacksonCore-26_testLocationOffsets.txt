Intent: The test case `testLocationOffsets` is designed to verify that the `feedInput` method correctly updates the parser's location tracking, such as byte offsets and column numbers, when new input is fed into the parser in a non-sequential manner. This ensures the parser accurately tracks where in the input stream each token begins and the current read position, especially important for error messaging and complex parsing scenarios.

Repair Strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `_currInputProcessed`, `_currInputRowStart`, and related location tracking variables inside the `feedInput` method are correctly updated when new input segments are fed in non-sequential order. This might involve recalculating offsets based on the cumulative input processed so far, rather than assuming a continuous flow of data. Additionally, ensure updates to these variables accurately reflect the positions from which new input is started, potentially resetting or adjusting these values based on the actual segments of input being processed. The goal is to maintain accurate tracking of the parser's position within the overall input, despite non-linear input feeding. This might also require adjustments to how the parser computes offsets from the beginning of the input data to handle cases where input is not fed in order from the beginning to the end of the data sequentially.
