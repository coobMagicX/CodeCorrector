Intent: The purpose of the test case `testEscapeNull1` is to verify that when the escape character is set to `null` in the CSV format configuration, the CSVPrinter should correctly handle and output a backslash (`\`) character without escaping it.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle cases where the escape character is `null`. Specifically, the implementation should check if the escape character is `null` before attempting to escape any characters. If the escape character is `null`, the code should output the character as it is, without applying any escaping logic. This can be managed in the part of the code responsible for character escaping, ensuring that it respects the CSV format configuration.
