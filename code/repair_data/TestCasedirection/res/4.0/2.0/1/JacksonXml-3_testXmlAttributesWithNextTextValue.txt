Intent: The test case `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is intended to verify that the `FromXmlParser` correctly parses XML attributes and returns their values using the `nextTextValue` method. It tests the functionality of handling XML attributes as JSON fields and retrieving their values sequentially.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `nextTextValue` method correctly handles transitions between XML attributes and their values. The method should set `_currToken` to `JsonToken.VALUE_STRING` and return `_currText` when an attribute's value is requested. If the method currently fails to return the correct value or incorrectly handles the token state between attributes, the source code should be modified to handle these transitions explicitly. Possible changes might include adjusting the way `_currToken` and `_nextToken` are managed to ensure that `_currText` is correctly updated and returned when `nextTextValue` is called following an attribute name.
