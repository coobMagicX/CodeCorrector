Intent: The test case `testStringBuilder` intends to deserialize a JSON string into a `StringBuilder` object using the `readValue` method of a `MAPPER` object, and then checks if the `StringBuilder` object correctly holds the deserialized string.

Repair strategy: The problem may lie in the handling of deserialization in the `readValue` method, specifically when it comes to constructing `StringBuilder` objects or other mutable types not directly supported. The source code should be inspected for how type deserialization is managed, particularly checking if there's a missing or incorrect handler for `StringBuilder`. The repair should involve ensuring that there is a properly implemented deserialization mechanism for `StringBuilder` or modifying the existing one to handle mutable types correctly. This may involve adjusting the `verifyNonDup` method to properly manage or recognize constructors or factory methods for types like `StringBuilder`.
