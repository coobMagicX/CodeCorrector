Intent: The test case `handlesKnownEmptyStyle` is intended to verify that the HTML parser correctly handles empty `<style>` tags by ensuring they are parsed and output as `<style></style>` instead of self-closing `<style />`. This is to ensure compatibility with HTML standards where certain elements like `<style>` should not be self-closing.

Repair strategy: Modify the `handleRawtext` function or related parsing logic to recognize and correctly handle self-closing tags for elements like `<style>`. The repair should ensure that such tags are converted to open and close tag pairs (`<style></style>`) instead of being left as self-closing tags in the parsed HTML output. This might involve adjusting the tokenizer or parser state transitions to correctly interpret and convert self-closing tags for specific elements according to HTML standards.
