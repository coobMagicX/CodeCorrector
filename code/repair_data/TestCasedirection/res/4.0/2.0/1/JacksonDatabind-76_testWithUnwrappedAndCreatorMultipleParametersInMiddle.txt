Intent: The test case `testWithUnwrappedAndCreatorMultipleParametersInMiddle` is designed to verify that the `Animal` class is correctly deserialized from a JSON object containing multiple properties, some of which are used to instantiate the object using a creator method, while others set properties on the object. It checks if the fields like `id`, `name`, `age`, and `alive` status are correctly set after deserialization.

Repair strategy: The issue indicated by the test failure (`assertEquals(30, animal.getAge())`) suggests that the age is not being correctly deserialized and assigned. In the source code, properties that need to be buffered and later set on the object are handled by buffering them first and then setting them when the object is built. It seems that the `age` property might not be correctly buffered or set. The repair should involve ensuring that the property `age` is correctly identified as either a creator property or a regular property, buffered if necessary, and correctly applied when constructing the `Animal` object. Debug and verify the buffering logic and the property assignment logic within the loop that processes each property to ensure all properties, including `age`, are handled correctly. Also, check the setter methods in the `Animal` class to ensure they are correctly implemented.
