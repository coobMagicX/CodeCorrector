Intent: The intent of the test case `testEqualsCS2` is to verify that the `StringUtils.equals` method correctly compares different CharSequence implementations (e.g., String, StringBuilder) for equality, handling cases where the strings are of equal length and content, strings of different lengths, and strings differing in case sensitivity.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle comparisons between different implementations of `CharSequence` that are not both instances of `String`. The current implementation returns a result based on the `CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches` method when the sequences aren't both `String` instances. It is crucial to ensure that this utility method is correctly comparing sequences of different lengths and contents accurately. If `CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches` is found to be faulty or not handling cases as expected, it should be revised to correctly compute and compare the lengths and character sequences, or an alternative approach should be used to ensure accurate comparison across different types of `CharSequence`.
