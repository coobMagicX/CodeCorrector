Intent: The intent of the failing test case `absHandlesRelativeQuery` is to verify that the `absUrl` method correctly handles URLs that are relative and contain query parameters. Specifically, it checks if the method can append a query string to an existing URL while maintaining the correct base path or file.

Repair strategy: Modify the URL resolution logic in the `absUrl` method to correctly handle the combination of a base URL and a relative URL that starts with a query parameter. Ensure that if the relative URL is just a query (i.e., starts with '?'), it appends the query to the last segment of the base URL path without removing the existing file name. This will likely involve adjusting how the URL is concatenated or using a different method to merge the paths and queries. Consider refining the logic that builds the absolute URL to preserve the file path in the base URL when the relative URL contains query parameters.
