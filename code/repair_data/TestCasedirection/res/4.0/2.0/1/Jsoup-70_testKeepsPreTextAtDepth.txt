Intent:
The intent of the test case `testKeepsPreTextAtDepth` is to verify that the method `preserveWhitespace` correctly identifies elements within deeply nested structures (like `<pre>` tags) that should preserve whitespace in the rendered text. This is crucial for accurately displaying code or preformatted text in HTML documents, where whitespace and newlines are significant.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should involve ensuring that the method `preserveWhitespace` correctly checks all ancestor elements of a node, not just its immediate parent, to determine if whitespace should be preserved. This involves potentially modifying the recursive checking logic to traverse up through all ancestors until the root is reached or a tag that preserves whitespace is found. The current implementation might be failing because it only checks up to five levels up or does not correctly check deeper nested structures. Adjust the method to ensure it captures all necessary cases where whitespace preservation is required as specified by any ancestor's tag.
