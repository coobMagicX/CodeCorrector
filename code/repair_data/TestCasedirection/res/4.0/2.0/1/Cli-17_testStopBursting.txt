Intent: The test case `testStopBursting` is designed to check the behavior of the `burstToken` method when encountering an option that is not defined in the options list, given the `stopAtNonOption` flag is set to true. The test aims to verify that the parsing stops when an undefined option is encountered and that this undefined option, along with the rest of the string, is treated as a non-option argument.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `burstToken` method correctly handles scenarios where an undefined option is encountered while `stopAtNonOption` is true. Specifically, the code should properly add the entire substring starting from the first undefined option to the list of non-option arguments, and it should not parse any further options after that point. The loop in `burstToken` should break immediately after adding the non-option argument to ensure no further options are processed. Additionally, make sure that the `tokens` list does not include any further split options or characters from the input string after an undefined option is encountered.
