Intent: The test case `testUnrecognizedOption2` is designed to check whether the parser correctly identifies and throws an exception for unrecognized command line options. The intent is to ensure that the parser can handle unexpected options gracefully and inform the user about the specific unrecognized option.

Repair strategy: Modify the `parser.parse` method to accurately detect options that are not defined in `options` and throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` with the correct option as a parameter. Ensure that the `processOptionToken` method or related parsing logic checks against the defined options and correctly identifies when an encountered token is not among the recognized options. This may involve validating each token against the available options before proceeding with any parsing or token addition logic.
