Intent: The test case `attributeWithBrackets` is designed to ensure that the HTML parser correctly handles attribute values with special characters such as brackets and parentheses. This is crucial for accurately selecting elements based on attribute values that may include potentially confusing or nested delimiters.

Repair strategy: The issue likely stems from the `chompBalanced` function, which is intended to correctly pair opening and closing characters (like brackets) and handle nested structures within strings. The function should be reviewed and potentially modified to better handle cases where special characters appear within attribute values but do not necessarily denote nested structures. This can involve improving the logic that decides when to increase or decrease the `depth` based on whether characters are truly opening or closing a segment, or are simply part of the attribute string. Additionally, ensuring that escape characters are correctly recognized and handled can prevent misinterpretation of subsequent characters.
