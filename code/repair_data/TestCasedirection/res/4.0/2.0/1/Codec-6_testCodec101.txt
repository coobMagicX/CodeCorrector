Intent: The intent of the test case `testCodec101` is to verify that the `Base64InputStream` correctly reads a Base64 encoded input stream and handles the end-of-stream condition appropriately. It specifically tests the scenario where after successfully reading data, a subsequent read operation should indicate that there is no more data to read (end-of-stream).

Repair strategy: Investigate and adjust the handling of read operations in the `Base64InputStream` class to ensure that it properly signifies an end-of-stream (-1) after all encoded data has been read. This might involve ensuring that the `base64.readResults()` method correctly returns -1 when no more data is available to decode, particularly after a successful initial read. This could also require checking the conditions under which data is passed to the `base64` object for encoding/decoding to ensure that all data is processed in the first read if applicable, or correctly handled across multiple reads.
