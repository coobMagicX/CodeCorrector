Intent: The test case `skipUsingRead` is designed to test the `skip` method of the input stream when the overridden `skip` method in `FilterInputStream` always returns 0. This situation simulates scenarios where the `skip` method cannot skip any bytes due to stream constraints or errors, and is intended to ensure the `skip` method in the source code handles such cases gracefully and accurately.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle cases where no bytes are skipped by the `skip` method of `InputStream`. This could involve adding a fallback mechanism to manually read and discard bytes up to the requested number if the `skip` method is ineffective. This ensures that the source `skip` function can still fulfill its purpose even when the underlying stream's `skip` method is unable to skip bytes.
