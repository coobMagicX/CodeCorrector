Intent: The test case "survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader" is intended to verify that the method `parsePaxHeaders` can correctly handle and parse Pax headers from a tar file input stream, even when there are blank lines present within the headers. The purpose is to ensure that the parsing does not fail or result in incorrect parsing when encountering empty or whitespace-only lines.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a condition that checks for and ignores blank lines or lines that do not contain any meaningful header information (i.e., lines that do not follow the "length keyword=value" format). This could involve checking if `len` is zero after calculating it and before proceeding with parsing the keyword and value, effectively skipping over blank or malformed lines.
