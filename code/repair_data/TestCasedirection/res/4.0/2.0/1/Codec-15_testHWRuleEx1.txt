Intent:
The test case `testHWRuleEx1` is designed to validate the encoding rules for a string transformation system, likely a Soundex or similar phonetic encoding algorithm. This system is expected to correctly encode names by following specific rules around letter transformation and ignoring certain conditions, such as consecutive letters that map to the same number or letters separated by 'H' or 'W'. The intent is to ensure that the output is consistent and adheres to documented phonetic encoding rules.

Repair strategy:
The source code should be revised to ensure that it correctly handles cases where characters like 'H' or 'W' are involved in the encoding process. Specifically, the `getMappingCode` function needs to be reviewed to confirm that it properly implements the rule where a character that maps to the same number as the character preceding an 'H' or 'W' (which itself follows another character) should be ignored or treated differently as per the encoding rules. Adjust the logic that checks and processes the characters around 'H' and 'W' to ensure that they are handled according to the specified phonetic rules, perhaps by refining the condition that determines when to return '0' or continue with the mapped character. This might involve more accurately tracking character mappings and their relations to 'H' and 'W', ensuring these special cases do not incorrectly alter the expected encoded result.
