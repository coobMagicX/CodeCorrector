Intent: The intent of the test case is to ensure that the `HelpFormatter` class can handle scenarios where the input does not fit within the specified width without entering into an infinite loop or crashing the program. The test aims to validate proper text wrapping and formatting functionalities in scenarios challenging due to line length restrictions.

Repair strategy: Investigate and correct the logic within the `renderWrappedText` method where the `pos` (position to wrap the text) calculation might not be updating correctly under certain conditions, causing an infinite loop. Particularly, ensure that after padding is added to the text, the new wrap position (`pos`) calculation takes into account any changes made by the padding to avoid `pos` remaining unchanged. Modify the `findWrapPos` function or the way it's used to correctly handle edge cases involving padding and narrow widths.
