Intent: The test case `testEndMb` aims to validate the Caverphone encoding of strings that include the sequence "mb", specifically at the end and in repetition within the string. The expected behavior is that "mb" at the start of a string should be transformed to "m2" and any subsequent "mb" sequences should be handled consistently, ensuring that the final encoded output meets a fixed length of 10 characters, padded with '1's.

Repair strategy: The error likely exists in the handling of the "mb" sequence in the source code. The sequence "mb" at the beginning of a word is supposed to be replaced with "m2". However, it seems that subsequent occurrences of "mb" are not handled correctly if they occur again within the string, or the combination of the final processing and padding does not correctly adjust for multiple occurrences. The repair should focus on ensuring that:
1. The "mb" to "m2" replacement is consistently applied across the entire string, not just at the beginning.
2. The final encoding length should be properly managed to meet the 10 characters requirement, considering that internal "mb" replacements may alter the length of the transform.
3. Review and adjust the regex patterns, especially concerning the handling of repeated patterns and ensure the sequence of replacement operations does not unintentionally remove or alter characters which are part of the "mb" pattern in unintended ways.
