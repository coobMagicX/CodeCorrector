Intent: The intent of the test case `testLocalPartialType609` is to serialize an `EntityContainer` object containing a `RuleForm` entity with a specific value (12) to JSON and then deserialize it back to an `EntityContainer` object, ensuring that the `value` field of the `RuleForm` entity remains unchanged throughout the serialization and deserialization process.

Repair strategy: The likely issue lies in the handling of generic types during deserialization, where the type information of `RuleForm` might not be properly maintained or resolved. The repair should focus on ensuring that during the deserialization process in `ObjectMapper`, the generic type information (like that of `RuleForm` inside `EntityContainer`) is correctly interpreted and utilized. This might involve adjusting the `_fromVariable` method to better handle cases where type variables are present and ensuring that the type bindings are correctly applied and maintained during the entire deserialization process.
