Intent: The test case "createsFormData" is designed to verify if the formData method correctly accumulates and returns a list of form data from various types of input elements, including handling of selected options in a select element, checked checkboxes and radio buttons, as well as ignoring disabled fields and unchecked options.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on making sure that:
1. The default value for checkboxes ("on") is correctly handled when no explicit value is provided.
2. Only selected options in multi-select scenarios are added to the data list.
3. Disabled inputs are not included in the formData output.
4. Textareas are properly processed and their contents are included in the formData, ensuring textareas are recognized and handled correctly in the loop.
