Intent: The purpose of this test case is to verify that the `parseByteData` method correctly parses HTML content from a ByteBuffer which starts with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM). The test ensures that the BOM is properly discarded during the parsing process, allowing the HTML content to be interpreted correctly without any preprocessing artifacts affecting the document structure.

Repair strategy: The focus should be on ensuring that the method `parseByteData` handles and discards the BOM correctly when present at the start of the data. The repair should include checking the initial characters of `docData` after it is decoded and before it is passed to the parser. If a BOM is detected (`\uFEFF`), it should be removed from the string. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to strip out the BOM if it is found at the start of the string, ensuring that the parser receives clean HTML content without any leading special characters.
