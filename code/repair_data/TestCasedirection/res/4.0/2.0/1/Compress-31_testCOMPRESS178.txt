Intent: The test case `testCOMPRESS178` is designed to ensure that the `parseOctal` method properly throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when encountering invalid input data in a tar archive file, which should be caught and wrapped into an `IOException` by the calling method. The test specifically checks the robustness of error handling in the context of reading tar archive entries, expecting the process to halt with a specific exception when incorrect or malformed data is encountered.

Repair strategy: Investigate how exceptions are handled in the method or methods that call `parseOctal`. Ensure that any `IllegalArgumentException` thrown by `parseOctal` is appropriately caught and rethrown as an `IOException` in the context of tar file processing. This might involve modifying the exception handling logic in the `getNextEntry` method of the tar processing class to correctly interpret `IllegalArgumentException` as a critical error and wrap it inside an `IOException`. This adjustment will allow the test to pass by meeting its expectation of receiving an `IOException` under error conditions.
