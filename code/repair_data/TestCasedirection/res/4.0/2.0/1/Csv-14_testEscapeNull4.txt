Intent: The intent of the test case `testEscapeNull4` is to verify that the `CSVPrinter` correctly handles and outputs backslashes when the escape character is set to `null`. This implies that the test expects the printer to output backslashes as they are, without any modification or escaping.

Repair strategy: The issue likely arises because the `printAndQuote` method does not handle the scenario where the escape character is `null`, and it may be incorrectly escaping or modifying backslashes even when no escape character is defined. To repair the source code, ensure that the `printAndQuote` method checks if the escape character is `null` and, if so, bypasses any escaping logic, directly outputting the value as is. Additionally, confirm that the method handling escape logic (not shown in provided source but referred to by the test case) correctly adheres to this behavior.
