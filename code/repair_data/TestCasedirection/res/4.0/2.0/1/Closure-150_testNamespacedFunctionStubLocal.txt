Intent: The test case `testNamespacedFunctionStubLocal` is intended to verify that a namespace object (`goog`) correctly registers a function stub (`foo`) with a specified type annotation in a local scope. The test checks if the `goog` object has the property `foo`, if the property type is correctly set and declared, and if the type matches the expected type in the local variable scope.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the handling of namespaced properties within the source code to ensure that properties like `goog.foo` are correctly registered and recognized in the scope handling logic. This may include ensuring that property registration considers namespace scoping and that type annotations for such properties are correctly parsed and applied. Additionally, ensure that the `defineVar` method or equivalent logic that processes variable and property definitions handles namespaced properties appropriately.
