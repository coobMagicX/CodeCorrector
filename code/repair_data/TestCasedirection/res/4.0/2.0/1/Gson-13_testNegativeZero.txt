Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testNegativeZero` is to verify that the JSON parser correctly identifies and returns the string representation of a negative zero (`-0`) when reading from a JSON array. This is important for ensuring that the parser accurately handles numerical edge cases, particularly in non-lenient mode.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly handle and return "-0" as a valid number. This involves modifying the `peekNumber` method to recognize "-0" as a valid numeric value rather than rejecting it as an error or an unallowed leading zero condition. Specifically, the condition that checks for a leading zero (`value == 0`) needs refinement to allow "-0". This might involve adding a specific check for "-0" or adjusting how negative numbers are parsed and validated. Ensure that this adjustment does not interfere with the existing logic for detecting invalid octal numbers or other numeric formats.
