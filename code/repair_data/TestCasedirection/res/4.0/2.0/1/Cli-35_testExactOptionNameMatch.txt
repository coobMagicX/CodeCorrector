Intent: The test case `testExactOptionNameMatch()` is intended to verify that the parser correctly identifies and handles an option when given an exact match of the option name. The purpose is to ensure that the command line parser can correctly parse and recognize options that are exactly specified by the user.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the code inside `getMatchingOptions(String opt)` is capable of returning the exact match efficiently when it exists. It seems that the method might be adding multiple options that start with the provided option prefix rather than checking for an exact match. The repair should include a check to differentiate between exact matches and prefix matches. If an exact match is found, the method should return a list containing only this exact match to ensure that the parser behaves as expected for exact option names. This might involve adjusting the logic within the `for` loop or adding additional conditions to handle exact matches distinctly from prefix matches.
