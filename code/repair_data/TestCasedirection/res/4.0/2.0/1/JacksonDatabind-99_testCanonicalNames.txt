Intent: The purpose of the test cases is to ensure that the `toCanonical` method correctly generates canonical names for various Java generic types, including handling generics for standard collections, maps, enums, and custom generic types like `AtomicReference`. The test checks if the method can accurately represent both simple and complex generic structures in their canonical form and also verify that these types can be reconstructed from their canonical representations.

Repair strategy: The source code should correctly handle the building of canonical names for complex nested types and parameterized generics. The current implementation in `buildCanonicalName` likely lacks logic to handle nested generics or multiple type parameters effectively. The repair should involve enhancing the `buildCanonicalName` method to recursively resolve generic type parameters and append them correctly into the StringBuilder. This should include handling different numbers of type parameters and nested type parameters accurately.
