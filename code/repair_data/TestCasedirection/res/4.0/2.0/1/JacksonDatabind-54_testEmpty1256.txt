Intent: The test `testEmpty1256` is designed to verify that the serialization process correctly handles the `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` inclusion rule, which should result in the exclusion of both `null` values and values that are considered "absent" by their nature (like Java 8 Optionals that are empty, or possibly other similar types). The expected output of serializing an instance of `Issue1256Bean` under this inclusion rule is an empty JSON object (`{}`).

Repair strategy: Review and ensure that the `buildWriter` method properly handles the `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` case by checking for and suppressing both `null` and "absent" values appropriately. This might involve:
1. Confirming that the declared type of the bean properties in `Issue1256Bean` correctly identifies properties as reference types or other types that could be "absent".
2. Ensuring that the serialization logic within `buildWriter` correctly interprets and applies the `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` rule, effectively filtering out both `null` and "absent" values during serialization.
3. Checking if the `Issue1256Bean` class properties are properly annotated or configured to match expected behavior under `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT`.
4. Verifying that the custom serializers and null handling in the `buildWriter` method do not inadvertently override or ignore the specified inclusion rules.
