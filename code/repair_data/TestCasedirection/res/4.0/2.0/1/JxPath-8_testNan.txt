Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to validate the behavior of the `compute` method when handling comparisons involving NaN (Not a Number) values. The test checks if the method correctly identifies and handles comparisons of NaN with NaN and NaN with other numeric values according to IEEE floating point rules, where any comparison involving NaN should return false, except for NaN equal to NaN, which should return true.

Repair strategy: Modify the `compute` method to properly handle NaN comparisons. The current implementation converts operands to double values and uses typical comparison operators, which do not adhere to the IEEE rules for NaN. Implement checks to specifically identify NaN values and return the correct boolean values for comparisons involving NaN. Use `Double.isNaN(double)` to check if a value is NaN and adjust the logic to return the appropriate boolean values for each case, following the rules that comparisons involving NaN should always return false, except for NaN equals NaN which should return true.
