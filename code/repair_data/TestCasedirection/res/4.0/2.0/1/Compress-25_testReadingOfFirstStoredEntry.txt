Intent: The intent of the test case `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is to verify that the `ZipArchiveInputStream` correctly reads the first entry from a .zip file and confirms both the size of the entry and the exact content of the data stored in the entry. The test ensures that the entry size matches expected values and the content of the entry is exactly as expected byte-for-byte.

Repair strategy: Given that the fault-revealing line is `assertArrayEquals(new byte[] {'d', 'a', 't', 'a', '\n'}, IOUtils.toByteArray(in));`, the issue likely lies in how the `ZipArchiveInputStream` reads the data from the zip file or how it interprets the boundary of zip entries. The potential error could be in the handling of entry boundaries, incorrect handling of decompression (if applicable), or incorrect setup of the input stream buffer. The key repair direction would be to review and potentially correct:
1. The logic in `getNextZipEntry()` to ensure it correctly identifies the boundaries and content of each zip entry.
2. The handling and configuration of the `PushbackInputStream` and its buffer size to ensure it matches the needs of typical zip entry sizes and does not truncate or incorrectly read the entry data.
3. Verify and ensure that encoding issues or incorrect interpretation of extra fields (if unicode extra fields are used) are not altering the reading process.
