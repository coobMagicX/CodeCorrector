Intent: The test case "handlesInvalidAttributeNames" is designed to verify if the method `copyAttributes` correctly handles and filters out invalid XML attribute names when converting an HTML document (parsed by Jsoup) into a W3C-compliant XML document. The test checks if attributes with invalid characters (according to XML specifications but valid in HTML5) are either correctly handled or omitted.

Repair strategy: Modify the `copyAttributes` method to ensure that attribute names containing characters not allowed in XML (even if valid in HTML5) are either removed or sanitized properly before setting them on the XML `Element`. This could involve enhancing the regular expression used to filter out invalid characters or adding additional logic to handle special cases like attributes that end with a quotation mark or contain other disallowed punctuation. The goal is to ensure that no invalid XML attributes are attempted to be set on the W3C DOM elements, thus preventing any potential exceptions or errors during the DOM conversion process.
