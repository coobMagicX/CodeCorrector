Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue785` is to verify that the `matchConstraint` method correctly modifies an object (`out`) to match a specified constraint when passed as a parameter to a function. The constraint in this case is either a string or an object with a property `prop` that can either be a string or undefined. The test checks if the type of the object `out` is correctly set to `{prop: (string|undefined)}` after being passed to function `f`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `matchConstraint` method to ensure it can handle constraints that are not only record types but also other types like unions of primitives and record types. The current implementation only checks for record types (`isRecordType()`), hence it might be ignoring the case where the constraint includes a union type that involves a record type. Implement a logic to extract and apply the record type constraint from a union type correctly in the `matchConstraint` method.
