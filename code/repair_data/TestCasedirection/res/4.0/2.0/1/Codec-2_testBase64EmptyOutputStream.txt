Intent: The intent of the test `testBase64EmptyOutputStream` is to verify that the Base64 encoding function correctly handles an empty input array without producing any output or errors, both when encoding byte-by-byte and by chunks. It tests the function's ability to manage zero-length data and return an appropriate empty output, ensuring the encoder can gracefully handle edge cases without unnecessary processing or errors.

Repair strategy: The source code should explicitly check for an empty input case (`inAvail == 0`) before proceeding with any encoding logic. If the input is empty, the function should immediately set `eof` to true and exit without modifying the output buffer or attempting any encoding operations. This ensures that no operations are performed when there is no data to process, avoiding any potential errors or incorrect handling of buffer positions or modulus calculations. Ensure that this check is placed at the beginning of the method to preempt any unnecessary processing.
