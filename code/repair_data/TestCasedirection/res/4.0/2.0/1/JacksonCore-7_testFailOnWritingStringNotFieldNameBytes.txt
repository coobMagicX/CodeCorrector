Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldNameBytes()` is to verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where a string is attempted to be written as a value, rather than as a field name, in a JSON object context. This test likely ensures that the code correctly manages the state transitions and validations when handling strings in different contexts (object, array, root).

Repair strategy: Analyze and adjust the state management within the `writeValue()` method to ensure that it properly checks whether the writing context requires a field name or a value. This might involve introducing additional conditions or flags to track the expected input types (field name vs value) based on the current context (_type). Ensure that the method returns an error or handles the situation correctly when a string value is written where a field name is expected in an object context.
