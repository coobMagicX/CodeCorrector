Intent: The intent of the test case `testCodec98NPE` is to verify that the `Base64OutputStream` can correctly decode a base64 encoded string without throwing a NullPointerException (NPE), particularly when handling padding and stream closure.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that the `buffer` is initialized and sufficiently sized before attempting to modify or access its content, especially when closing the stream and finalizing any partially decoded data. Moreover, checks should be added to handle edge cases where the input data ends abruptly or the input length is not a multiple of 4 (which is typical for base64 encoded data). This would prevent access to uninitialized or out-of-bound areas in the buffer, thus avoiding a NullPointerException.
