Intent: The intent of the test case `testEqualsCS1` is to ensure that the `StringUtils.equals` method correctly compares different `CharSequence` instances, including handling null cases, comparing different lengths, and case sensitivity.

Repair strategy: The source code should be updated to handle comparisons of `CharSequence` instances that are not of type `String` correctly. Specifically, the method should ensure that it compares the contents of two `CharSequence` objects accurately even when their lengths differ. The current implementation might not be correctly handling the length comparison or the substring comparison for different lengths. Ensure that the `CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches` method is implemented correctly to handle these cases, or adjust the logic in `StringUtils.equals` to correctly handle comparisons when `CharSequence` lengths are different.
