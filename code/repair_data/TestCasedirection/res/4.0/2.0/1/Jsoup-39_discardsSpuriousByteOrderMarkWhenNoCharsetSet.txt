Intent: The test case "discardsSpuriousByteOrderMarkWhenNoCharsetSet" is intended to verify that the method `parseByteData` correctly handles a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start of an HTML string when no charset is explicitly set. The test ensures that the BOM is correctly discarded and does not affect the parsing of the HTML content, and that the default charset (UTF-8) is used for decoding.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the BOM (if present) is detected and properly discarded before the HTML content is parsed. This involves checking the initial characters of the `docData` string for the presence of a BOM and removing it if found. After removing the BOM, the method should verify that the charset used for further operations defaults to UTF-8 unless specified otherwise by HTML meta tags. Ensure that the BOM handling logic correctly resets the `byteData` buffer to decode again using the appropriate charset after BOM removal.
