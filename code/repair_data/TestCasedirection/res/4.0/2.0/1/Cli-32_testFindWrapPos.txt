Intent: The purpose of the test case labeled "wrap position 3" is to check if the method `findWrapPos` correctly identifies the wrap position when faced with a substring ("aaaa aa") where a break should occur exactly at the width limit (3 characters in this case). The method is expected to return the position index 3, which is the space character after "aaa".

Repair strategy: The code should correctly handle cases where there is no whitespace, newline, or carriage return characters within the specified width, but such characters exist just at the boundary. The current implementation may not correctly handle the edge case where the boundary is exactly at a whitespace after the specified width. To address this:

1. Ensure that the condition inside the loop checking for whitespace, newline, or carriage return characters correctly handles the case when these characters are exactly at the position `startPos + width`.
2. Adjust the boundary checks to correctly return the position of whitespace if it is precisely at the `startPos + width` without going out of bounds.
3. Review and adjust the logic that increments or decrements the position (`pos`) to ensure it does not skip over potential wrapping points exactly at the boundary defined by `width`.
