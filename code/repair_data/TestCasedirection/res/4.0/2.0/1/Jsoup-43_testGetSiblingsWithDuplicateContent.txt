Intent: The intent of the test `testGetSiblingsWithDuplicateContent` is to verify the correct behavior of sibling navigation methods (`previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`, `firstElementSibling`, `lastElementSibling`) within an HTML document parsed by Jsoup. Specifically, it checks that these methods accurately identify and return the correct sibling elements in the presence of duplicate text content and specific IDs.

Repair strategy: Investigate and potentially revise the implementation of sibling navigation methods (`nextElementSibling`, `previousElementSibling`, `firstElementSibling`, `lastElementSibling`) in the Jsoup library to ensure they are correctly handling cases where elements have non-unique text content or are specifically identified by attributes like IDs. The issue may lie in how these methods traverse the DOM tree and identify the correct siblings based on the current element's position. Ensure that the methods account for all siblings accurately, especially in complex DOM structures with nested and repeated content.
