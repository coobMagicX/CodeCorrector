Intent:
The test case `testIZeroIndex` is designed to confirm that the method `_parseIndex` correctly handles the parsing of strings representing array indices in a JSON pointer. It checks two conditions: first, a single zero ("0") should be successfully parsed as index 0; second, a string with leading zeroes ("00") should not be parsed as a valid index and should return -1, adhering to the no leading zeroes rule.

Repair strategy:
The current implementation of `_parseIndex` should be adjusted to explicitly handle cases where the string represents a numeric index with leading zeroes, returning -1 in such cases. However, the exception should be made for the string "0", which is a valid index. The repair should include adding a check to verify if the string is exactly "0" before it rejects indices with leading zeros, thereby correctly parsing "0" as 0 and strings like "00" as -1. This strategy would involve refining the conditional checks for character validation and length checks to distinguish between a valid "0" and invalid numbers with leading zeroes.
