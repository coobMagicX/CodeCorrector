Intent: The test case `testMixinWithBundles` intends to test whether the `ObjectMapper` correctly applies a mixin configuration to serialize an object of class `Foo` in a modified format specified by `FooMixin`. The expected serialization format is JSON with a specific structure, `{"bar":"result"}`, which likely differs from Foo's default serialization.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that the mixin configuration in the `ObjectMapper` may not be applied correctly, or the serialization setup in `FooMixin` does not alter the output as expected. The repair should focus on:
1. Ensuring that `FooMixin` is correctly defining the serialization properties to achieve the desired output.
2. Verifying the correct application and integration of mixins in the `ObjectMapper`. This may involve checking how mixins are registered and processed during serialization.
3. Testing the serialization process separately to confirm that `Foo` objects are serialized as expected when the mixin is applied, potentially involving debug logging or breakpoints to trace the serialization process.
