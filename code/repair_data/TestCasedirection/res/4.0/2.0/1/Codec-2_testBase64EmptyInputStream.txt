Intent: The test case `testBase64EmptyInputStream` is designed to verify that the encode method can correctly handle an empty input stream. This includes ensuring that no data is erroneously encoded and that the function can gracefully handle a zero-length input without crashing or producing incorrect output.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the encode function checks for an empty input (`inAvail == 0`) and directly returns or handles it appropriately without proceeding with encoding processes that assume data is present. This might involve adding a condition at the start of the function to check if `inAvail` is zero and if so, return immediately or ensure that the downstream logic within the function naturally handles a zero-length appropriately without side effects.
