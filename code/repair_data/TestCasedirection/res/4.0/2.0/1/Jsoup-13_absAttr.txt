Intent: The provided test case `absAttr()` is intended to verify that the method `attr()` correctly retrieves the absolute URL from the `href` attribute of selected elements in an HTML document parsed by Jsoup. This is important for cases where the HTML element's `href` attribute might be a relative URL, and retrieving it as an absolute URL is necessary for functionality that depends on complete URL paths.

Repair strategy: The failure of the test case suggests that the `attr()` method in the source code may not be correctly converting relative URLs to absolute URLs when the attribute key specified is `"abs:href"`. The source code needs to be revised to ensure that whenever `"abs:href"` is requested, the method should check if the URL is relative and if so, convert it to an absolute URL by appropriately resolving it against the base URL of the document. This might involve modifying the `attr()` method or ensuring that the method which resolves URLs is correctly implemented and integrated.
