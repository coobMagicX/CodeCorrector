Intent: The test case is designed to check the behavior of the CSV parser when headers are missing or empty and should be ignored if `withIgnoreEmptyHeaders(true)` is enabled. This is to verify that the parser can handle CSV files with intentionally empty headers without causing errors or exceptions, and still correctly map the columns to their respective indices.

Repair strategy: The code needs to be adjusted to handle cases where headers are empty and the `ignoreEmptyHeaders` flag is set. Specifically, when headers are empty and should be ignored, the code should skip adding these headers to the `hdrMap`. This involves modifying the condition inside the header processing loop to ensure that empty headers are not added to the map when `ignoreEmptyHeaders` is true. Additionally, there should be checks to ensure that headers considered 'null' due to the use of `withNullString("")` are handled appropriately, either by treating them as empty or by implementing specific logic to manage null-equivalent headers.
