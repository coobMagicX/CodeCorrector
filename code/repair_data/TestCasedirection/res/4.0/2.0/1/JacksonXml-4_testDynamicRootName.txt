Intent: The intent of the test case `testDynamicRootName` is to verify that the XML serialization respects dynamically configured root names even when serializing null values. It seeks to ensure that the root name provided ("rudy" in this case) is used correctly in the outputted XML, especially for the edge cases where the serialized content is null.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the `_serializeXmlNull` method to correctly apply the configured dynamic root name when serializing null values. This could involve ensuring that the root name "rudy" is used instead of a default or incorrect root name when the serialized object is null. This might require checking and updating the logic that handles root names in the serialization process to dynamically use the root name set in the `ObjectWriter` configuration. The check within `_initWithRootName` should be verified to ensure it correctly applies the root name from the context (if set) before serialization. Additionally, it's important to ensure that any fallback or default naming logic correctly defers to this explicitly set root name.
