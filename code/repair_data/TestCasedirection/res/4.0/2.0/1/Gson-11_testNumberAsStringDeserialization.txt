Intent: The test case `testNumberAsStringDeserialization` is intended to verify that the method correctly deserializes a number represented as a JSON string into a `Number` object and that the integer value of this object is as expected.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle cases where numbers are represented as JSON strings. The current implementation only accounts for numbers presented directly as JSON numbers and null values. To resolve the issue, update the `switch` statement to include a case for handling `STRING` tokens that can be parsed into numbers. This can be implemented either by directly parsing the string to a number or by enhancing the `LazilyParsedNumber` to handle numeric strings correctly.
