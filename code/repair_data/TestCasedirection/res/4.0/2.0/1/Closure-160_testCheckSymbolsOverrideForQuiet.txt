Intent: The test case `testCheckSymbolsOverrideForQuiet` is intended to verify that the compiler correctly identifies and reports an error for undefined variables when the warning level is set to QUIET, but JavaScript compilation errors like undefined variables are explicitly set to be treated as errors.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to ensure that the `options.checkSymbols` is accurately interpreted in conjunction with the warning level settings and the specific errors like `undefinedVars`. If `options.checkSymbols` is false and the warning for undefined variables is not explicitly disabled by the warning level or other settings, the compiler should still report these as errors. Adjust the logic in the `initOptions` method to correctly handle the combination of `--warning_level=QUIET` and `--jscomp_error=undefinedVars` to ensure undefined variable errors are reported as per the test case requirements.
