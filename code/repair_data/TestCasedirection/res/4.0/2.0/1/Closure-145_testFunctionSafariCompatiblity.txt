Intent: The intent of the test `testFunctionSafariCompatiblity` is to ensure that functions nested within conditional statements (`if` statements) are correctly formatted with braces `{}` to prevent syntax errors in Safari browsers. This is particularly crucial for cases where functions are directly within an `if` condition without braces, which could lead to incorrect interpretation in some JavaScript engines.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` method or the associated function printing logic to automatically insert braces around functions that are direct children of an `if` statement without existing braces. This should apply not only to simple `if` statements but also to more complex constructs like labeled statements within `if` conditions. The repair should ensure that any function declaration directly inside an `if` condition without braces is automatically enclosed with braces before it is printed or processed further.
