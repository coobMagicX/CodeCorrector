Intent: The test case `testEmpty()` intends to verify that the `TextBuffer` correctly handles empty states. It specifically checks that the `getTextBuffer()` method should return an empty array when the text buffer has been reset to an empty state, and that this remains true even after calling other methods such as `contentsAsString()`.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that the `getTextBuffer()` method might not correctly handle situations where the buffer is explicitly set to be empty. The source code should ensure that when `resetWithEmpty()` is called, all relevant fields (_inputBuffer, _resultArray, _resultString, etc.) are properly reset or set to reflect an empty state. Additionally, ensure that any method that manipulates these fields maintains the empty state unless explicitly modified to contain data. This will likely involve modifying both the `resetWithEmpty()` method and the `getTextBuffer()` method to handle the empty state more explicitly and consistently.
