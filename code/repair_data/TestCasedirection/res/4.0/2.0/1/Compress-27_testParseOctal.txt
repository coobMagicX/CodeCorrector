Intent: The test suite is designed to ensure that the method `parseOctal` correctly parses byte arrays representing octal numbers into their corresponding long values. It checks for correct handling of leading spaces, trailing spaces or nulls, and validates that the octal number parsing respects both normal and edge cases, such as maximum octal values and handling of improper octal values.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly refactor the code to correctly handle scenarios where the end of the buffer may include trailing nulls or spaces that are not being correctly adjusted before processing the octal value. Ensure that the logic which reduces the `end` index when encountering trailing spaces or null bytes accurately reflects the intended final position for parsing. This includes confirming the condition in the loop that adjusts `end` and ensuring that decrementing this value does not skip valid octal digits, especially in cases where the buffer length is exactly at the limit of octal number size. Additionally, verify and adjust the handling of buffers that start with a zero byte, as the current implementation may prematurely return zero without checking subsequent characters which might still form a valid octal number.
