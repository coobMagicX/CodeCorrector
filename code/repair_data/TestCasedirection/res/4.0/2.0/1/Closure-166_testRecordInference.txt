Intent: The intent of the test case `testRecordInference` is to verify that the function `f` correctly infers and applies type constraints to the object `out` based on its usage in `f`. The expected behavior is that `out` should be inferred to have the properties `a` (boolean or undefined) and `b` (string or undefined) as per the union type constraint provided to `f`.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to handle union types in constraints. Currently, the `matchConstraint` method only considers cases where the constraint is a single record type. To resolve the failing test case, the method needs to be enhanced to iterate over each type in a union of constraints, applying the necessary modifications to the object to match all possible constraints in the union. This might involve modifying `matchConstraint` to check for and handle cases where `constraint` is a union type, and then ensuring all applicable record type constraints are matched against the object.
