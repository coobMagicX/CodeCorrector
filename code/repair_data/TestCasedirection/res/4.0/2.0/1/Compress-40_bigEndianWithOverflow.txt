Intent: The test case `bigEndianWithOverflow()` is designed to verify the functionality of `readBits(int count)` method when processing a sequence of bytes with big-endian byte order, specifically testing boundary conditions and handling of bit overflows when reading a large number of bits (63 bits).

Repair strategy: The `readBits()` method must correctly handle the case where the number of bits cached (`bitsCachedSize`) approaches or exceeds the safe limit for bit operations (like left-shifting which can cause data loss or overflow if not managed properly). The repair should focus on ensuring that bits are correctly shifted and aligned when the byte order is big-endian, particularly when dealing with near-maximum bit sizes. This might involve correcting the bit-shifting logic under the big-endian branch to prevent overflows and ensure accurate reading of the specified number of bits, possibly introducing checks or adjustments when `bitsCachedSize` is close to 64 (the size of a long in Java). Additional logic may be required to handle cases where the total bits read exceeds the normal range, especially just before an overflow scenario.
