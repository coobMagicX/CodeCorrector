Intent: The intent of the test case `testBase64Text` is to verify that binary data can be correctly encoded into a Base64 string and then decoded back to binary data using different Base64 variants and data lengths. The test ensures round-trip encoding and decoding works as expected for various lengths and variants.

Repair strategy: The source code in `getBinaryValue` method does not properly handle the case where a `TextNode` should be converted back to binary data using the specified `Base64Variant`. The method currently retrieves binary data directly if available, or from an embedded POJO, but does not handle the conversion of Base64 encoded strings (from `TextNode`) back to byte arrays. To repair this, implement the logic within `getBinaryValue` to check if the current node is a `TextNode` and if so, use the provided Base64 variant to decode the text back into a byte array. This involves handling the Base64 decoding process using the variant parameter provided to the method, particularly when the node type is a `TextNode`.
