Intent: The test case "testListAllFilesWithNestedArchive" aims to validate that the main archive and nested archives are correctly read and processed, listing all files, including those within nested archives. It also checks that an exception is thrown and caught when attempting to create an archive stream from an unsupported file format.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that it can handle nested archives by correctly preparing the input stream for nested archive processing. It should also correctly propagate and handle exceptions that arise when attempting to process unsupported file formats within nested archives. Specifically, the repair should focus on the management of input streams and error handling within nested loops to ensure that exceptions are thrown, caught, and recorded as expected. Consider revising the method used to create and manage nested `ArchiveInputStream` instances, ensuring that it correctly interprets and handles nested archives and unsupported formats.
