Intent: The test case is designed to verify that the escape function correctly handles the escaping of '<' and '>' characters in XML attribute values while not escaping them in HTML attribute values. This behavior is crucial for generating valid HTML and XML documents where the requirements for character escaping differ.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code in the escape function to ensure that the '<' and '>' characters are correctly escaped when the output is intended for XML (using XHTML escape mode) and not escaped when the output is intended for HTML. This likely involves checking the escape mode and whether the character is within an attribute before deciding how to handle the escaping. Adjust the conditions under which '<' and '>' are escaped based on the combination of `inAttribute` and `escapeMode`.
