Intent: The test case `testCollectedFunctionStubLocal` is designed to verify whether a function stub defined within an anonymous function correctly tracks properties assigned to the `this` keyword. It checks if the created object `x` of type `f` has the property `foo` and verifies the type and inferred status of this property.

Repair strategy: Inspect the handling of properties assigned to the `this` keyword within functions, particularly in nested functions or closures. Ensure that properties assigned to objects through `this` in constructor functions are correctly registered and accessible in the object's type definition within the scope where the object is created. This might involve adjusting the `defineDeclaredFunction` method or how scopes handle property assignments to `this`.
