Intent: The test case "treatsUndeclaredNamespaceAsLocalName" is intended to verify that elements with undeclared namespaces are correctly parsed and converted from a Jsoup document to a W3C DOM document. Specifically, it aims to ensure that elements retain their tags and local names accurately even when the namespace is not explicitly declared.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to handle elements with undeclared or unknown namespaces correctly. When converting elements with prefixes (like "fb:like") that do not have a corresponding namespace declaration in the `namespacesStack`, the system should default to treating the prefixed tag as a local name without a namespace. This involves modifying the logic in `updateNamespaces` and the handling in the `head` method to account for cases where no valid namespace is associated with a prefix, ensuring that the `namespace` variable can be set to `null` (or an equivalent non-value) when no matching namespace is found. This will allow the system to better align with the expected behavior as outlined in the failed test case.
