Intent: The test case `testIterateVariable` is intended to verify that the XPath expression correctly evaluates whether the variable `$d` iterates through a list of values (`"a"` and `"b"`) and checks if each value can individually be equated to return true when compared with the string literals `'a'` and `'b'`.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the handling of equality checks between a variable iterator and a string. The source code seems to handle comparison between iterators and individual objects via the `contains` method, which may not be correctly implemented or invoked. To repair, ensure that when one operand is an iterator and the other is a non-iterator object, the comparison logic correctly determines if the non-iterator object is contained within the collection being iterated. This might involve checking or revising the `contains` method to accurately reflect containment of an object in an iterator sequence, or ensuring that iterators are correctly dereferenced to compare individual elements against the provided string. Additionally, confirm that the conversion of context types to iterators (if applicable) is functioning as expected.
