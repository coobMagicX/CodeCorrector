Intent: The test case `hasAbsAttr` is designed to verify that the method `hasAttr` correctly identifies if an attribute (in this case, "abs:href") is present in selected HTML elements. It specifically checks for absolute URL links in `<a>` tags, which should be present only when the URL begins with "http://" or similar.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly resolve and check for absolute URLs when the attribute key "abs:href" is queried. This might involve extending the `hasAttr` method or related functionality in the `attributes` object to handle special cases where the attribute needs to be derived or computed (like converting relative URLs to absolute URLs). The repair should ensure that `hasAttr` differentiates between absolute and relative URLs and responds accordingly.
