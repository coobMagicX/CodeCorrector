Intent: The test case aims to verify the serialization and deserialization of polymorphic types using a custom setup. It checks if the polymorphic types are correctly handled in both serialization to JSON and subsequent deserialization back into Java objects, ensuring the integrity and completeness of the data throughout the process.

Repair strategy: Investigate and potentially revise the logic in the `_findDeserializer` method to ensure it correctly handles polymorphic types during deserialization. Focus should be on how `_idResolver.typeFromId` and `ctxt.findContextualValueDeserializer` methods are used and whether they correctly interpret and utilize type information for polymorphic deserialization. Ensure that the type resolution and deserializer caching mechanisms (via `_deserializers.put`) work correctly for complex cases such as polymorphic types with custom resolvers. Consider enhancing the handling and logging of null or incorrect type resolutions to provide clearer diagnostic information during failures.
