Intent: The intent of the test `testMethodInference7` is to verify that the method overriding in JavaScript behaves correctly with respect to type compatibility between the overridden method and the overriding method, particularly when the overriding method introduces additional parameters.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that the type system correctly handles method overrides where the overriding method has more parameters than the overridden method. The source code handling the subtype checks should be modified to accurately check for compatibility in function signatures when methods are overridden, including scenarios where additional parameters are introduced in the overriding method. This might involve adjusting the logic that checks parameter types and counts, ensuring it aligns with expected object-oriented behavior in JavaScript.
