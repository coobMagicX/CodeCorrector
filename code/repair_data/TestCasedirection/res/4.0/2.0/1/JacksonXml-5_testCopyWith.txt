Intent: The test case aims to verify that creating a copy of an `XmlMapper` instance and altering its serialization features (specifically disabling annotations) results in serialization behaviors that respect these changes. Specifically, it checks that when annotations are disabled, the serialized XML does not use the annotated names but defaults to using the class name.

Repair strategy: Adjust the copying mechanism in the `XmlSerializerProvider` to ensure that changes in the serialization configuration (such as disabling annotations) are propagated correctly to the copied instance. This might involve ensuring that the copied instance does not inadvertently share reference-dependent properties (like `_rootNameLookup`) which may not reflect the updated configuration settings. A deep copy of necessary components or a selective copy strategy that respects the updated settings might be required.
