Intent: The intent of the test case `handlesFramesets` is to ensure that the `clean` method properly handles and sanitizes HTML documents containing framesets by removing potentially unsafe elements like frames, scripts, and preserving the structure and safety as defined by a basic whitelist.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly adjust the implementation of the `copySafeNodes` method to ensure it correctly filters out non-whitelisted tags and attributes, especially frames and scripts, which are typically not part of a basic whitelist. This might involve enhancing the logic that checks node types and attributes against the whitelist. If the `copySafeNodes` method does not currently consult the whitelist, integrate this functionality to ensure only safe, whitelisted content is copied to the clean document.
