Intent: The intent of the test `testAsEmbedded` is to verify that the `JsonGenerator` can handle `null` inputs gracefully by writing them as "null" in JSON output, and also to confirm that an appropriate exception is thrown when an unsupported object type (like a `Class` object) is passed to `writeEmbeddedObject`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `writeEmbeddedObject` method to check if the input object is `null` and handle it by writing a "null" string to the output, instead of throwing an exception for all inputs. The method should continue to throw an exception for non-null inputs that are not supported types. This allows the code to pass the test cases checking for null input handling while maintaining the behavior of throwing exceptions for unsupported types.
