Intent: The `testFileValidator` intends to validate that the command line parser correctly handles an option with a required file argument, ensuring that the file exists and is correctly recognized by the parser.

Repair strategy: The problem may reside in the parser configuration or the `validate` method in handling file validation. The outline for repair should include:
1. Ensuring that the `parseAndHelp` method is correctly implemented to process and validate file paths provided as command line arguments.
2. Review and possibly adjust the `FileValidator` implementation to accurately check for file existence.
3. Verify that the `validate` method in the source code correctly checks and enforces the required options and their arguments, particularly focusing on handling file existence validation.
4. Debug the integration of the `FileValidator` with the command line options to ensure that the file validation logic is triggered correctly during command line parsing.
