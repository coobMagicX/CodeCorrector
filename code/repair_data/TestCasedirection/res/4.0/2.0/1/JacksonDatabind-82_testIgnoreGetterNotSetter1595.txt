Intent: The intent of the test case `testIgnoreGetterNotSetter1595` is to verify that the serialization process correctly ignores the `name` field when serializing the object `Simple1595`, but the deserialization process should still populate the `name` field when data is provided. This tests the configuration of property inclusion/exclusion in serialization and deserialization.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be inspected and possibly modified to ensure that the property `name` is set to be ignored during serialization but not during deserialization. This could involve checking the configuration settings in the ObjectMapper or modifying how properties are handled in the `addBeanProps` method to differentiate between serialization and deserialization settings, possibly using annotations or configuration flags to manage this behavior more explicitly. Ensure that the `IGNORED` property list does not permanently remove the ability to set this property during deserialization.
