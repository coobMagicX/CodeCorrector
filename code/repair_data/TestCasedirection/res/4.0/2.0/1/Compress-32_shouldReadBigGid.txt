Intent: The test case 'shouldReadBigGid' is designed to verify that the application can correctly handle and read large Group ID values that exceed the size limits of a standard integer, particularly in the context of a POSIX-compliant TAR archive.

Repair strategy: Update the source code to properly handle large numeric values for Group ID. This may involve ensuring that the TarArchiveEntry class and related methods support larger number formats (like long or BigInteger) instead of just integer for the Group ID. Also, ensure that when parsing and setting these values, the application correctly handles the conversion and storage of large numbers, potentially adjusting the BigNumberMode configuration as needed to support this.
