Intent: The test case is designed to verify that when an `Element` object is cloned, the clone should have its own independent set of class names. Modifications to the set of class names in the cloned object should not affect the original object's class names.

Repair strategy: Modify the `clone` method to ensure that the `classNames` set is deeply cloned. Currently, it appears that the `classNames` set is being shared between the original and the cloned object, leading to the failure observed in the test case when changes to the clone's class names reflect back on the original. Implement deep copying for the `classNames` set so that the original and the clone have separate instances of the set. This can be achieved by creating a new set for the `classNames` in the clone and copying all elements from the original set into the new set.
