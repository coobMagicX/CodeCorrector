Intent: The purpose of the test case `testQuotedCharset` is to verify that the function `getCharsetFromContentType` correctly extracts and normalizes charset values from a content type string, even when the charset value is quoted. It aims to handle various charsets, both in lowercase and uppercase formats, and also tests the function's response to unsupported charsets.

Repair strategy: To address the failure observed in the test case, the source code should be modified to properly handle quoted charset values. This includes adjusting the regex pattern used to match charset values in the `charsetPattern` so that it can effectively strip quotes from around the charset string if they exist. The repair should ensure that the function can handle both quoted and unquoted charset values seamlessly. Moreover, the code should convert the charset to a consistent case (upper or lower) before returning it to fulfill normalization requirements.
