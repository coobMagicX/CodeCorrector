Intent: The test case "caseSensitiveParseTree" verifies that the HTML parser correctly handles and preserves the case sensitivity of tags when parsing HTML content. The parser settings are configured to maintain the original case of the tags, ensuring that uppercase and lowercase tags are treated distinctly and preserved as such in the output.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the implementation of the `anyOtherEndTag` function and related parsing methods to ensure they respect and preserve the case of HTML tags as per the parser's settings. Specifically, ensure that comparisons and manipulations involving tag names handle cases correctly based on the specified parser settings. This may involve modifying how `normalName()`, `nodeName()`, and comparison operations are implemented or utilized, ensuring that they are case-sensitive when required by the parser settings.
