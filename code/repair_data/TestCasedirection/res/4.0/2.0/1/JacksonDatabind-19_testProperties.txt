Intent: The test case `testProperties` intends to validate that when a `Properties` class is constructed into a `JavaType` using a `TypeFactory`, it not only checks the class type and raw class but also ensures that the key and content types of the resulting `MapType` are correctly identified as `String` classes.

Repair strategy: The failure of the test case suggests that the method `_mapType` may not be handling the type parameterization of the `Properties` class correctly, particularly not returning the expected `String` types for key and content. The repair should focus on modifying the `_mapType` method to correctly identify and handle the `Properties` class as a special case where both the key and content types are `String`. This could involve setting a conditional check specifically for `Properties` class to manually set both type parameters to `String.class` when constructing the `MapType`.
