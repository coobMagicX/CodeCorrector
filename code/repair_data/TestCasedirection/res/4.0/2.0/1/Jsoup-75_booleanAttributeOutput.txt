Intent: The test case `booleanAttributeOutput` is designed to verify that the source code correctly handles the HTML output of boolean attributes in an element. It checks whether boolean attributes are correctly minimized or displayed based on their values and the HTML syntax rules (i.e., `noshade`, `nohref`, and `async` should be minimized while `autofocus` with a value of `false` should not be minimized).

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to correctly handle the output of boolean attributes based on their values:
1. Modify the conditional logic within the loop that processes attributes to ensure that:
   - Attributes that are boolean and set to their own name or are empty (`""`) should appear without a value (e.g., `noshade`, `nohref`).
   - Non-boolean attributes or boolean attributes with a value different from their name (like `autofocus="false"`) should display with their respective values.
2. Specifically, ensure that the code checks and differentiates when a boolean attribute's value is explicitly set to `false`, as this should not be minimized.
3. Review and possibly refactor the condition inside the if statement that decides whether to append the attribute value. Ensure that this logic aligns with HTML5 attribute handling for both boolean and non-boolean attributes.
