Intent: The test case "usesOnForCheckboxValueIfNoValueSet" is intended to verify that when a checkbox input is present in a form without a specified value attribute but is checked, the default value submitted should be "on", as per HTML form behavior standards.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle the case where a checkbox input is checked but does not have a value attribute. Specifically, check if the `val` attribute of a checkbox is empty or not provided and default it to "on" before adding it to the form data collection. This will ensure that when a checkbox is checked and has no explicit value, it will use "on" as the default value.
