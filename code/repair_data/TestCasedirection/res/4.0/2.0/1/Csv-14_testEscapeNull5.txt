Intent: The test case `testEscapeNull5` intends to verify that the CSVPrinter correctly handles the printing of escape characters when the escape character is set to null. The specific scenario being tested is printing a string consisting of two backslashes ("\\\\") without any escape character defined, expecting the output to remain as two backslashes.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle cases where the escape character is set to null. This adjustment should ensure that when no escape character is defined, the input string is printed as is, without any modification. The repair should specifically address the handling of escape sequences in the `printAndQuote` or related methods to ensure that it does not attempt to escape characters when the escape character is null. This may involve checking if the escape character is null before processing escapes or handling the output formatting differently in such cases.
