Intent: The test case `testNineEmptyFiles` likely intends to test the `writeBits` method's ability to handle the scenario where it is called to write zero bits (length = 0) across multiple files or instances (in this case, 9 times). This is typical to ensure that the method can gracefully handle cases with minimal or no data without causing errors such as infinite loops, incorrect memory allocation, or writing incorrect data.

Repair strategy: Inspect and modify the `writeBits` method to ensure it correctly handles cases where `length` is zero. This might involve adding a condition at the beginning of the method to return immediately if `length` is zero, thereby preventing any further processing or erroneous writing operations. This condition helps to avoid unnecessary operations or potential errors when there are no bits to write. Additionally, ensure that any loop or conditional logic inside the method accounts for the scenario where `length` equals zero, preventing any out-of-bound errors or unnecessary writes to the `DataOutput` object.
