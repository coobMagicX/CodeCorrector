Intent: The test case `testLocalType728` is designed to verify that the method `constructType` correctly resolves both the return type and parameter type of a method to `JavaType`, ensuring that the resolved type matches the expected type (`CharSequence` in this case) both for type-erased and generic type scenarios.

Repair strategy: The failure point `assertEquals(CharSequence.class, t.getRawClass());` suggests that the method `constructType` might not be correctly handling the resolution of generic types, possibly due to incorrect handling of type variables or bounds in the `_fromVariable` method. The specific issue could arise from not properly resolving or handling the types when contexts are involved or when bounds of type variables are considered. The repair should focus on ensuring:
1. Correct handling and resolution of type variables in the presence of a `TypeBindings` context.
2. Proper parsing and consideration of the bounds of type variables, potentially handling multiple bounds or recursive type definitions more accurately.
3. Additional checks or logic to ensure that the type resolution process correctly identifies and matches the expected type (`CharSequence` in this scenario) when dealing with both type-erased and generic types.
