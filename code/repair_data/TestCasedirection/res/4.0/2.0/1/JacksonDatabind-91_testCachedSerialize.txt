Intent: The purpose of the failed test case is to verify that the custom key deserializer is correctly utilized during the deserialization of a JSON string into a Java Map object, where the keys are expected to be modified by the custom deserializer (appending " (CUSTOM)" to each key).

Repair strategy: The repair direction should focus on ensuring that the custom key deserializer is correctly registered and applied during the deserialization process. This may involve checking the configuration of the ObjectMapper instance to ensure it is aware of the custom deserializer. Additionally, verifying the implementation in the MapHolder class for the custom deserialization logic might be necessary to confirm that the custom key transformations (e.g., appending "(CUSTOM)") are being applied as expected.
