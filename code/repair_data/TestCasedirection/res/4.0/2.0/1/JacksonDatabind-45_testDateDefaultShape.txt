Intent: The test cases are designed to validate the proper serialization of date objects in JSON using Jackson, specifically testing how date serialization respects various configurations and annotations like `@JsonFormat` and global serialization features such as `WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS`. The tests aim to ensure that the output JSON matches expected formats under different settings.

Repair strategy: The code should be adjusted to correctly handle the `@JsonFormat.Shape.ANY` condition in the `createContextual` method. Currently, the source code does not seem to effectively deal with the `Shape.ANY` scenario, especially when combined with specific patterns or locales, resulting in incorrect or unexpected date formats in the serialized JSON output. A clear handling mechanism for `Shape.ANY` should be implemented, possibly defaulting to the user's global configuration or an explicitly provided pattern, ensuring that the serialization output matches the expected JSON structure as defined in the test cases.
