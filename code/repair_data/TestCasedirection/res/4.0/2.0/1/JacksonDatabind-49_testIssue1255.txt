Intent:
The intent of the test case `testIssue1255` is to ensure that the serialization and deserialization processes handle object identity properly. Specifically, it checks that when an object (such as `mo.bar1`) is referenced multiple times within another object (`mo`), it should maintain its identity after being converted to JSON and then back to an object.

Repair strategy:
The repair strategy should focus on ensuring the Jackson ObjectMapper configuration correctly handles object identity during serialization and deserialization. This can be achieved by:
1. Ensuring that the `ObjectMapper` is configured to preserve object references. This can typically be managed through the use of features like `mapper.enableDefaultTyping()` or specifically configuring it to handle object references.
2. Reviewing and possibly modifying the `generateId` function to ensure that it supports object identity correctly. This may involve ensuring that the ID generation process is aware of and respects existing object identities, particularly when objects are reused within the data structure.
