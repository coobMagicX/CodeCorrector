Intent: The test case is intended to validate that the method `getValues` handles option arguments correctly by returning the provided arguments along with the appropriate defaults when the number of arguments provided is less than the maximum specified.

Repair strategy: Adjust the `getValues` method to correctly handle merging user-provided values with the default values when the number of provided arguments is less than the maximum specified. Ensure that the logic for augmenting the list includes adding only the necessary default values to meet the maximum condition, rather than replacing or ignoring user-provided values.
