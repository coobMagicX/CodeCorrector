Intent: The intent of the test case `testFormatWithoutPattern` is to verify that the serialization of date objects respects a custom date format specified without using a pattern configuration within the ObjectMapper, and that the serialized output matches an expected JSON format.

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed and updated to properly handle cases where a date format is set on the ObjectMapper but no specific pattern is passed through the JsonFormat annotation or similar configurations. The JsonSerializer should correctly interpret and apply the ObjectMapper's DateFormat when no other configuration overrides are provided. The logic inside `createContextual` needs to ensure that it correctly identifies and applies the custom DateFormat from the ObjectMapper when no specific pattern or other format overrides are explicitly set on the serialization context or property. Adjustments may also be required to ensure that the timezone and locale settings are properly applied in conjunction with the custom format.
