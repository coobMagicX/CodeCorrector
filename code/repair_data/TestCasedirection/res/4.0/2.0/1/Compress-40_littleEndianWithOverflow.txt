Intent: The intent of the `littleEndianWithOverflow` test case is to ensure that the `readBits` method can correctly handle reading bits across multiple bytes in little endian byte order, while properly managing bit overflows due to large bit requests.

Repair strategy: The failure at reading 12 bits after a 63-bit request suggests a problem in managing the `bitsCached` and `bitsCachedSize` variables when large numbers of bits are read and approach or exceed the bit size of `bitsCached`. The test case failure indicates possible incorrect bit shifting or masking operations when handling boundary conditions (e.g., when `bitsCachedSize` is reduced after reading bits). Check and adjust the bit shifting or masking logic in both the read operation and the subsequent size adjustment to ensure that bits are being calculated and stored correctly without loss or corruption, especially at the boundaries of the byte cache size. Consider implementing an overflow check mechanism or reevaluating the way bits are shifted and truncated when `bitsCachedSize` exceeds or is close to the size of the data type holding the cached bits.
