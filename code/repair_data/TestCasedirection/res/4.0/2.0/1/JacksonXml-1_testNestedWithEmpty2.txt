Intent: The test case `testNestedWithEmpty2` is designed to ensure that the XML parsing correctly handles XML structures with nested but empty elements, specifically verifying that empty nested elements are recognized and processed as valid albeit empty entities in the resulting data structure.

Repair strategy: To fix the source code to pass this test, we need to adjust the parsing logic to correctly handle cases where XML elements are empty (like `<VehicleActivity></VehicleActivity>`). This involves ensuring that such empty elements are not skipped or ignored but are instead added as empty objects or lists to the parent data structure. Specifically, the logic handling `XML_TEXT` and conditions determining if an element is a "leaf" node might need revision to ensure empty elements are correctly processed and represented in the resulting parsed structure. Adjustments might also be required in how end elements (`XML_END_ELEMENT`) are processed to ensure they correctly finalize empty nodes.
