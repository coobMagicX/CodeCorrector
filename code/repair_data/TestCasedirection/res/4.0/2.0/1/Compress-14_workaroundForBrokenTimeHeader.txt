Intent: The intent of the test `workaroundForBrokenTimeHeader` is to verify the functionality of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when reading entries from a TAR file, particularly when entries may have broken or incorrectly formatted time headers. The test aims to confirm that the file name, last modified date, and symbolic link status are accurately retrieved from a TAR entry despite potential header issues.

Repair strategy: The failure related to the `tae = in.getNextTarEntry();` line suggests issues with how the `parseOctal` method handles non-standard or unexpected time header formats in TAR files. The likely problem is that this method, which is used for parsing octal values (such as file permissions, sizes, and timestamps) from the header, may not correctly handle cases where these values are malformed or represented in an unexpected way, leading to incorrect parsing and subsequent errors in the archive entry retrieval process.

1. Review and modify the `parseOctal` method to ensure robust handling of edge cases, such as non-standard header formats or unexpected character encodings. This includes improving error handling and potentially adding more flexible parsing logic that can handle slightly non-compliant TAR headers.
2. Enhance the validation and error reporting within `parseOctal` to provide clearer diagnostics when encountering malformed entries, which could aid in debugging and maintenance.
3. Implement additional unit tests specifically targeting the handling of non-standard or broken TAR headers to ensure the `parseOctal` method's resilience and correctness under such conditions.
