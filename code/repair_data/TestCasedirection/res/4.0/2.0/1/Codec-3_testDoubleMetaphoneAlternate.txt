Intent: The test case `testDoubleMetaphoneAlternate` is intended to verify that the `doubleMetaphone` method produces the correct alternate phonetic representation (typically, the secondary encoding) of a given list of strings (`TEST_DATA`). Each string in the list is processed to ensure the method outputs match the expected alternate phonetic values stored alongside the strings in the `TEST_DATA` array.

Repair strategy: The failure of this test case suggests that the `doubleMetaphone` method may not be handling specific edge conditions or string patterns correctly when generating the alternate (secondary) phonetic encodings. The key direction for repair would involve:
1. Reviewing the `doubleMetaphone` method's logic that deals with the calculation of the alternate phonetic representation to ensure it correctly interprets and transforms all relevant string patterns as defined in the phonetic encoding rules.
2. Ensuring that all branches and conditions in the `doubleMetaphone` logic (especially in the `handleG` method and others involved in the computation) are correctly implemented and handle edge cases appropriately.
3. Testing individual components or conditions within the `doubleMetaphone` method with a variety of inputs to isolate and correct any inaccuracies in the encoding logic, focusing especially on those transformations that impact the secondary encoding output.
