Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue941` is to test the deserialization of an empty JSON object into two different types: `ObjectNode` and a custom class `MyValue`. The test case verifies that both deserializations handle an empty JSON object correctly.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the deserialization process of the `MyValue` class, which might not be handling empty JSON objects correctly or is not properly configured to use a custom deserializer if needed. To resolve this, ensure that the `MyValue` class has a suitable deserializer that can handle empty JSON objects, or adjust the existing deserializer to correctly process empty JSON inputs. Additionally, check if annotations or configuration settings are correctly applied to the `MyValue` class to support its deserialization process.
