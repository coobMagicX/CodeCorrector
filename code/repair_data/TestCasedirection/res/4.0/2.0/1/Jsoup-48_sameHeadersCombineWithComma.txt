Intent: The intent of the test case `sameHeadersCombineWithComma` is to verify that if a header has multiple values, they should be combined into a single string separated by commas. This is based on the HTTP/1.1 specification which allows multiple message-header fields with the same field name to be combined into a single header field, separated by a comma.

Repair strategy: Modify the `processResponseHeaders` method to concatenate all values of the same header into a single string, separated by commas, before setting the header. Currently, the method only takes the first value of each header (`values.get(0)`). The code needs to be updated to iterate over all values in the `values` list for each header, combine them into one string with commas, and then use this combined string as the value for the header in the response object.
