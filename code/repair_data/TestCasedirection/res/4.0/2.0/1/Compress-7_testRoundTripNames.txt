Intent: The purpose of the test case `testRoundTripNames` is to verify the functionality of the `parseName` method, ensuring it correctly parses a string from a byte array starting from a given offset up to a specified length. It checks for proper handling of normal strings, strings with special characters, newline characters, null characters, and complex strings with non-standard characters and formatting.

Repair strategy: The failing test case that contains complex and special characters (`"0302-0601-3±±±F06±W220±ZB±LALALA±±±±±±±±±±CAN±±DC±±±04±060302±MOE.model"`) suggests that the `parseName` method may not be handling non-ASCII characters correctly. Since Java `char` is a 16-bit Unicode character, the method should be capable of correctly converting all valid byte values to characters. However, special handling or encoding issues might be causing the problem. 

1. Verify and correct the character encoding handling in the `parseName` method. Ensure that it supports the full range of characters that can be represented in the byte array, especially non-ASCII characters.
2. Consider using a different approach to convert bytes to characters if the current method (casting bytes directly to chars) is causing issues with non-ASCII characters. This might involve using a `Charset` for decoding byte arrays to strings.
3. Add specific tests for encoding to ensure that all types of characters are correctly parsed and handled by the method.
