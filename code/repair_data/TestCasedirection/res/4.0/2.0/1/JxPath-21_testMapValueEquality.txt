Intent: The test `testMapValueEquality` is designed to verify that the XPath expressions evaluating the equality and inequality of elements within a map are functioning correctly. Specifically, it checks whether the expressions correctly assess whether different keys ('a', 'b', 'c') in the map are equal or not, as defined by the XPath statements.

Repair strategy: Review and correct the implementation of the XPath evaluation functionality or the underlying map structure used in the context. Ensure that the equality and inequality logic in the XPath evaluation accurately reflects the distinctions and similarities between different map values as expected. This may involve debugging the methods that handle map value retrievals or the XPath parser itself, focusing on how different data entries are compared within these evaluations.
