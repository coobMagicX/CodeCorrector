Intent: The intent of the test case `testUnknownTypeIDRecovery` is to verify how the deserialization process handles JSON with known and unknown type identifiers, ensuring that known types are properly deserialized and unknown types are managed or ignored without causing the process to fail. This ensures robustness and fault tolerance of the deserialization mechanism in scenarios where not all data can be mapped to predefined classes.

Repair strategy: Modify the `deserialize` method to properly handle different types of JSON fields instead of skipping all children unconditionally. Implement conditional logic to check the type of the incoming JSON tokens and handle each type appropriately. Specifically, add logic to:
- Properly parse and create objects for known fields and ignore or log unknown fields based on the configuration set in `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_INVALID_SUBTYPE`.
- Ensure that the deserializer is capable of handling nested structures and different data types according to the structure defined by `CallRecord` and similar classes.
- Return a properly instantiated object instead of null, ensuring that fields like `item2` in the JSON are deserialized into corresponding Java objects when they match expected types.
