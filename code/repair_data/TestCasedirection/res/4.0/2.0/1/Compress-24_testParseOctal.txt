Intent: The test case `testParseOctal()` is designed to validate the `parseOctal` function's ability to correctly parse and convert sequences of bytes representing octal numbers into their long integer equivalents. This includes handling edge cases such as maximum values, trailing spaces, trailing nulls, and empty or nearly empty inputs.

Repair strategy: The source code needs adjustments to correctly handle edge cases and boundary conditions specified in the test:
1. Ensure the function correctly processes the maximum octal value that can fit in a long without causing overflow (handling of 12 digits where some implementations might use an extra digit).
2. Modify error handling to avoid exceptions with valid inputs such as trailing spaces or nulls, ensuring that the function trims these correctly before parsing.
3. Adjust the loop that trims trailing nulls and spaces to correctly handle cases where the buffer may contain these values but still represents a valid number.
4. Review and possibly refactor the check for valid octal digits (`'0'` to `'7'`) to ensure that no valid octal input throws an unnecessary or incorrect exception.
5. Confirm that the implementation aligns with both typical use and edge cases, such as an input buffer filled with zeros or spaces, which should validly return 0.
