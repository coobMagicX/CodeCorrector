Intent: The test case `testRead7ZipMultiVolumeArchiveForStream` is designed to ensure that the `ZipArchiveInputStream` correctly handles reading from a multi-volume archive, specifically when it encounters a truncated file. The test verifies that the system throws appropriate exceptions when attempting to read beyond the available data in a truncated archive entry, and when trying to access additional entries after a truncation error.

Repair strategy: The source code should be enhanced to better handle the scenario where the end of the stream is reached unexpectedly due to truncation. This involves adding checks to ensure that the stream correctly identifies when an archive entry is truncated and throws an appropriate exception. The method `read` in the `ZipArchiveInputStream` likely needs an additional condition to detect truncation and handle it by throwing an `IOException` with a specific message, such as "Truncated ZIP file". This can be done by validating the expected size of the entry against the actual bytes read from the stream and ensuring any discrepancies that indicate truncation result in an immediate and informative exception. Additionally, ensure that subsequent attempts to read new entries after a truncation also result in exceptions, preventing further reads.
