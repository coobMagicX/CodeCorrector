Intent: The test case `testPropertyOptionFlags` is designed to verify that the method `processProperties` correctly handles the addition of options to the `CommandLine` based on the properties provided. It tests various conditions, such as the case sensitivity of boolean values and the scenario where the option should not be added if it requires an argument but the provided value does not meet the required criteria.

Repair strategy: The source code should be adjusted to ensure that options which do not require an argument are correctly handled, particularly when the loop encounters values that are not "yes", "true", or "1". The current `break` statement in the `else if` block prematurely exits the loop, which likely causes subsequent options to be ignored. This needs to be replaced with logic that continues processing the remaining elements in the enumeration without adding the current option to the `CommandLine` if the condition fails. Additionally, the handling of options that accept arguments (like "e") should be reviewed to ensure they are added correctly regardless of the specific boolean value.
