Intent: The intent of the test case `testEscapeBackslash4()` is to verify that the method `printAndQuote` correctly handles the printing of backslashes in CSV output. The test checks if a pair of backslashes are correctly printed as two backslashes, suggesting that it should treat backslashes as normal characters and not escape them additionally.

Repair strategy: The repair should ensure that backslashes are not being incorrectly escaped or modified when passed through the `printAndQuote` method. The source code needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that backslashes are treated as literal characters without additional escaping, particularly in the sections of the code that handle quoting and character checks. This might involve adjusting the conditions that determine when a character should be quoted or escaped, or possibly altering the logic that appends characters to the output to ensure that backslashes are appended correctly.
