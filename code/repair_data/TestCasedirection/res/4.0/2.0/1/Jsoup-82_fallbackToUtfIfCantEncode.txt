Intent: The intent of the test case `fallbackToUtfIfCantEncode` is to verify that the parser correctly falls back to using UTF-8 encoding when encountering a charset ("ISO-2022-CN") that can be read but not encoded during HTML parsing.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a check after determining the document's charset. If the identified charset is not encodable (i.e., it can't be used for output encoding), the parser should automatically revert to UTF-8. This can be done by checking if the charset can be used for both decoding and encoding in Java, and if not, setting it to UTF-8 before finalizing the parsing process. Ensure this logic is placed after charset detection but before the final parsing step to ensure all text is correctly encoded in the document output settings.
