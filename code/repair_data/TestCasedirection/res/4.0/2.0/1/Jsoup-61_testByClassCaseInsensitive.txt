Intent: The test case `testByClassCaseInsensitive` is designed to verify if the `hasClass` method can correctly identify HTML elements by class names in a case-insensitive manner. It checks if the method can handle different cases of the same class name specified in HTML and ensure that all matching elements, regardless of case variations in their class attribute, are selected.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on improving the `hasClass` method to correctly handle and compare class names in a case-insensitive manner throughout the entire method. This includes ensuring that the method can accurately check each class name within an element that contains multiple class names separated by whitespace. The strategy should involve:
1. Verifying the initial handling of string lengths and the comparison logic to ensure it doesn't prematurely return false.
2. Ensuring that the loop and conditions properly parse and compare class names within a string that may contain multiple classes, maintaining case insensitivity throughout.
3. Reviewing the final check for the last class name in the attribute string to confirm it doesn't miss matching cases due to incorrect bounds or comparison logic.
