Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testPrintHelpLongLines` is to verify that the method `testPrintHelp` correctly handles and formats long lines of help text generated for various command line options in an application. This includes ensuring that the text is wrapped and indented properly according to specified widths and tab stops, maintaining readability and proper layout in the help output.

Repair strategy: The primary issue seems to lie in the `renderWrappedText` method, which may not be handling the addition of padding correctly, leading to incorrect wrap positions or infinite loops. To fix this:
1. Review and potentially adjust the logic in `renderWrappedText` to ensure that it correctly calculates the position at which text should wrap, especially after padding is added.
2. Modify the loop condition or the update of `pos` to prevent the infinite loop. Ensure that the update logic for `pos` after adding padding leads to a new wrap position.
3. Add safeguards or conditions to handle cases where text does not fit within the specified width even after wrapping, to avoid runtime exceptions and infinite loops.
4. Test the method with different lengths and configurations of input text to ensure robustness and correctness.
