Intent: The intent of the test case `testOrder` seems to be checking the behavior of the `CommandLine` object when querying for an option that does not exist, using a null as the option identifier. The test aims to ensure that when no arguments are passed, and subsequently queried with `null`, it should return false, indicating the option is not present.

Repair strategy: The failing test case indicates a problem not directly related to the functionality of the `stripLeadingHyphens` method but rather in the handling of null values and option management within the `CommandLine` or `PosixParser` classes. The repair should focus on ensuring that these classes handle null inputs gracefully, perhaps by implementing checks for null values before processing options in the `hasOption` method or during parsing in `PosixParser`. This will prevent any unintended behavior or errors when querying options that are not specified or are identified by null.
