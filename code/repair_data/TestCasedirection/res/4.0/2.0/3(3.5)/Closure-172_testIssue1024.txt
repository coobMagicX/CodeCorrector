Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the behavior of the `isQualifiedNameInferred` method when dealing with assignments to the `prototype` property of objects.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to update the `isQualifiedNameInferred` method to correctly handle assignments to the `prototype` property of objects. Specifically, the method should return `false` when the `qName` ends with `.prototype` and when the `rhsValue` is not a function.
