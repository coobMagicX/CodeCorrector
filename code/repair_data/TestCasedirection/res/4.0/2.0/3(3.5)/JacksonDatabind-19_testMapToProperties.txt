Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the conversion of a Java bean to a Properties object using the ObjectMapper's convertValue method. It aims to verify that the properties in the resulting Properties object match the values of the bean's fields.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the conversion of non-String values to String values when populating the Properties object.
