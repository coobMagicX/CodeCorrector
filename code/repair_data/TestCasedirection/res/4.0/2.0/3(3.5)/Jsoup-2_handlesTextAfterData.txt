Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to ensure that the text after a script tag is properly handled and included in the parsed HTML document.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the code to correctly handle the text after the script tag. This could involve checking if there is any text after the script tag and adding it as a separate text node to the parsed HTML document.
