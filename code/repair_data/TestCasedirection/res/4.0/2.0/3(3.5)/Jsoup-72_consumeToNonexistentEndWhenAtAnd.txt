Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify the behavior of the `consumeTo` method when the given character is not present in the input.

Repair strategy: The code needs to be modified to handle the scenario when the given character is not found in the input. Currently, it returns an empty string even when the character is not present, leading to a failing test case. The repair direction is to update the `consumeTo` method to return `null` or another appropriate value when the character is not found, and update the test case to assert the correct behavior.
