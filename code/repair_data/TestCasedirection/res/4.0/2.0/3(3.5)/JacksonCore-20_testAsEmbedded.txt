Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the functionality of the `writeEmbeddedObject()` method in the source code. The test cases aim to verify the behavior of writing embedded objects using the JsonGenerator.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the `writeEmbeddedObject()` method implementation to handle writing embedded objects correctly. The method should be updated to check if the object parameter is null and handle it accordingly. Additionally, the method should be modified to handle writing Class objects correctly without throwing an exception.
