Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the "readValue" method of the "MAPPER" object can correctly deserialize a JSON string into a StringBuilder object.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to investigate and fix any potential errors in the "readValue" method of the "MAPPER" object that prevent it from correctly deserializing the JSON string into a StringBuilder object.
