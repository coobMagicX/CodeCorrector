Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the code can handle an unclosed CDATA section at the end of the input.

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to handle an unclosed CDATA section at the end of the input without crashing. This can be done by adding a check to handle the case where the CDATA section is not closed properly.
