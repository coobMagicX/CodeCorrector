Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the `formData()` method correctly creates a list of `Connection.KeyVal` objects from the form elements in the HTML document.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the `formData()` method so that it correctly handles the different types of form elements and filters out disabled inputs, unchecked checkboxes, and non-submittable elements.
