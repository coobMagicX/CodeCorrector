Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that when no charset is set, the spurious byte order mark (BOM) is discarded and the document is parsed correctly.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the source code to handle the discarding of the spurious byte order mark correctly when no charset is set.
