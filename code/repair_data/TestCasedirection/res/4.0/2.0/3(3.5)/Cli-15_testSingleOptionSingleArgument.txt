Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the method `getValues` returns the correct list of values for a single option when the option has a single argument.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the logic in the `getValues` method to correctly retrieve and return the list of values for the specified option.
