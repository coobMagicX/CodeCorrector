Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that if a checkbox input element is checked but does not have a value attribute set, the formData method should use "on" as the value for that input field.

Repair strategy: The repair direction is to modify the formData method to set the value of the checkbox input element to "on" if it is checked and does not have a value attribute set.
