Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the `FilteringParserDelegate` when filtering for a specific property name and including the path to the property. The test case expects the parser to correctly navigate the JSON structure and return the expected tokens.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the logic in the `nextToken()` method of the `FilteringParserDelegate` class. The code should be modified to correctly handle the scenario where the filter matches a property name and the path needs to be included.
