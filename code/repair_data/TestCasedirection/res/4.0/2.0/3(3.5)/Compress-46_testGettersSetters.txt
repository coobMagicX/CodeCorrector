Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the code related to time stamp handling. Specifically, it is testing if the code correctly throws an exception when the timestamp is too big to fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the implementation of the `unixTimeToZipLong` method to handle timestamps that are too big. This could be done by either converting the timestamp to a valid value within the range of a signed 32-bit integer or by updating the method to handle timestamps of any size.
