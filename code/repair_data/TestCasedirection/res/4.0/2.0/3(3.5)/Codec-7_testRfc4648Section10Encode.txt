Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the correctness of the "encodeBase64String" method in the Base64 class. The test cases cover different input strings and ensure that the output of the method matches the expected Base64 encoded strings.

Repair strategy: The failing test case indicates that the encoding of the string "f" is producing an incorrect result. The repair direction would involve investigating the implementation of the "encodeBase64String" method and identifying potential errors that could lead to the incorrect output.
