Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the functionality of writing a binary object as an embedded object using the `writeEmbeddedObject` method.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to implement the functionality to write binary objects as embedded objects. This can be done by modifying the `writeEmbeddedObject` method to handle binary objects and convert them into the desired format for writing.
