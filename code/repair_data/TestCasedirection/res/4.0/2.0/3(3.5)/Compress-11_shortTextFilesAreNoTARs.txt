Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that attempting to create an ArchiveInputStream for a non-archive input stream throws an ArchiveException with the message starting with "No Archiver found".

Repair strategy: To fix this issue, the source code should throw an ArchiveException with the message "No Archiver found" when the input stream does not match any of the supported archive formats.
