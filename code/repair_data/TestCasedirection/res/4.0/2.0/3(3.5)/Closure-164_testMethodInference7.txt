Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the `isSubtype()` method when a function is overridden with a different parameter signature.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on correctly handling the case where the parameter signature of the overridden function is different from the original function. Currently, the code does not handle this case properly, resulting in the test case failure. The repair direction should be to modify the code to handle the mismatch in parameter types between the original and overridden functions.
