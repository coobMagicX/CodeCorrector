Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the behavior of the `readBits` method when reading bits in big-endian order.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the failing test cases is to fix the calculation of `bitsOut` in the `readBits` method to correctly handle big-endian byte order.
