Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the usage message is correctly printed when the argument name of an option is empty.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to modify the implementation of the `appendOption` method to handle the case when the argument name of an option is empty. Currently, the method does not handle this case correctly, causing the test case to fail.
