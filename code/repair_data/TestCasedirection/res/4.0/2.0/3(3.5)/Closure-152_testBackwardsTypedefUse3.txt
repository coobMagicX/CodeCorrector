Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to check if the code correctly handles the resolution of types in the `resolveInternal` method.

Repair strategy: The code needs to handle the resolution of the `@this` type correctly when it is a UnionType. The repair direction would be to update the code to handle the resolution of `typeOfThis` correctly when it is a UnionType.
