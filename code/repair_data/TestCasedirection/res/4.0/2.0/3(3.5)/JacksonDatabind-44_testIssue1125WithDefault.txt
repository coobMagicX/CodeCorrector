Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the deserialization of a JSON string into an object of type Issue1125Wrapper is successful and that the values are correctly assigned.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the deserialization process for the Issue1125Wrapper class so that it correctly assigns the values from the JSON string.
