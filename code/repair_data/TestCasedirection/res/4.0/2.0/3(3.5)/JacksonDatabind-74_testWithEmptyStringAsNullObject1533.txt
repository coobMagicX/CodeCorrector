Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that when an empty string is encountered as a value for a property, it is deserialized as a null object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the source code to handle the case when an empty string is encountered as a value for a property. The code should check if the property value is an empty string and deserialize it as a null object.
