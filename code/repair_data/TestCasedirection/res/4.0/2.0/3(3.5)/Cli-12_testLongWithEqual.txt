Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the "parse" method of the "parser" object correctly parses and retrieves the value of a long option with an equal sign.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the parsing logic in the "parse" method of the "parser" object to correctly handle long options with equal signs. The fix should ensure that the value after the equal sign is correctly assigned to the option.
