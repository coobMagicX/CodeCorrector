Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to deserialize a JSON string into a list of objects of type AnimalAndType using the `ObjectMapper` class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on identifying the potential error in the deserialization process. This could involve checking if the `ObjectMapper` configuration is correct, ensuring that the JSON string is properly formatted, or verifying if the `AnimalAndType` class and its dependencies are properly implemented.
