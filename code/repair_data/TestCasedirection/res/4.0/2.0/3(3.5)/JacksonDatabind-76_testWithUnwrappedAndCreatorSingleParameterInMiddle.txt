Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the deserialization of a JSON object with unwrapped properties and a creator method with a single parameter in the middle works correctly.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve investigating the deserialization process and the handling of creator properties to ensure that the value for the 'years_old' property is correctly assigned to the 'age' field of the 'Person' object.
