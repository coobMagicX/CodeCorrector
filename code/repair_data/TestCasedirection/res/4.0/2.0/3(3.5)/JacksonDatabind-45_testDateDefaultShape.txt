Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the serialization behavior of different scenarios involving date values.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to handle the case where the date needs to be serialized as a string with a specific format. Currently, the code only handles the case where the date is serialized as a numeric timestamp or as a default format. To pass the test case, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the serialization of dates with a specific format.
