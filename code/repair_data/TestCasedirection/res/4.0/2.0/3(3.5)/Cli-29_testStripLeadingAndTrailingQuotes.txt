Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the functionality of the stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes() method. It aims to verify if the method correctly removes the leading and trailing quotes from a given string.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code is to fix the logic for removing leading and trailing quotes. The current implementation is incorrect and does not handle cases where the string contains quotes in the middle. The code should be modified to remove only the leading and trailing quotes.
