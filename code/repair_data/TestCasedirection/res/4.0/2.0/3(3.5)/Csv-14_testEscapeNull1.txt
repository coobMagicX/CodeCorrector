Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the `printAndQuote` method when the escape character is set to null.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling the case when the escape character is null in the `printAndQuote` method. One possible direction for repair is to add a check for null escape character and handle it appropriately, such as not escaping any characters in this case.
