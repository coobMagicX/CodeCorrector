Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the writeBits method when given a length of 8 and an empty BitSet.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the writeBits method should involve handling the case where the length is greater than 0 but the shift value is greater than 0. The method should write the remaining cache value to the header in this case.
