Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the `writeBits` method when given 6 empty files.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to investigate the `testCompress252` method and understand how it is affecting the test case. Additionally, the `writeBits` method should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly handling the case of 6 empty files.
