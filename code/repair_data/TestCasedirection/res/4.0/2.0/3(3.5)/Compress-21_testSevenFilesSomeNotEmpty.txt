Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the functionality of the `writeBits` method when there are seven files and some of them are not empty.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this code is to investigate the `testCompress252` method and ensure that it is correctly setting up the test scenario and asserting the expected results.
