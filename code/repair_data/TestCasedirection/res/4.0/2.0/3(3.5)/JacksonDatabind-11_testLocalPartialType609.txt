Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the ObjectMapper can correctly deserialize a JSON string into an instance of the EntityContainer class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on identifying any issues in the deserialization process of the ObjectMapper. Specifically, the issue may be related to the deserialization of the EntityContainer class.
