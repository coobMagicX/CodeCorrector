Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that when an unexpected token is encountered while deserializing a JSON string into a Date object using the DefaultDateTypeAdapter, an IllegalStateException is thrown.

Repair strategy: To fix the failing test case, the source code needs to be modified to throw an IllegalStateException when an unexpected token is encountered during the deserialization process.
