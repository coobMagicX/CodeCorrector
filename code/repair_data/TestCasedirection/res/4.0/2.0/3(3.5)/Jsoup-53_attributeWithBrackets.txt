Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the "chompBalanced" method correctly extracts the text within the specified brackets.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve fixing the bracket mismatch in the test case. The closing bracket in the attribute selector of the first assertion is missing, causing the test to fail. Adding the missing closing bracket should fix the test case.
