Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that when serializing an object of type `Issue1256Bean`, the resulting JSON should be an empty object `{}`.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to modify the `buildWriter` method to handle the `NON_ABSENT` inclusion mode correctly. Currently, the code only checks if the `declaredType` is a reference type and sets `valueToSuppress` to `BeanPropertyWriter.MARKER_FOR_EMPTY`. However, for the `NON_ABSENT` inclusion mode, `valueToSuppress` should also be set to `BeanPropertyWriter.MARKER_FOR_EMPTY` when the property is absent. This can be achieved by adding a check for the `NON_ABSENT` inclusion mode and setting `valueToSuppress` accordingly.
