Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the ObjectMapper when a DeserializationProblemHandler is added to handle unknown type IDs.

Repair strategy: The source code can be repaired by updating the `_handleUnknownTypeId` method to return the actual JavaType instead of null. This can be done by modifying the code within the `if (actual == null)` block to construct and return the appropriate JavaType based on the unknown type ID.
