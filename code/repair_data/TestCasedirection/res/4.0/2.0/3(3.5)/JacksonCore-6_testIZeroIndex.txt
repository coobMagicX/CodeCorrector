Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to check the behavior of the `getMatchingIndex()` method in the `JsonPointer` class. It seems that the test cases are checking the index matching functionality for JSON pointers.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the logic in the `getMatchingIndex()` method in the `JsonPointer` class. The method should correctly handle the parsing and matching of the index in the JSON pointer.
