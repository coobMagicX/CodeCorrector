Intent: The purpose of the test case is to verify the deserialization of a JSON string into an object of type Authentication1872 using the ObjectMapper class.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to investigate the deserialization process and potential errors in the source code that prevent the successful deserialization.
