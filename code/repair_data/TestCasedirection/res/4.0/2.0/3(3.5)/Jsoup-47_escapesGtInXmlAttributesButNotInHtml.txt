Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the ">" character is escaped in XML attribute values but not in HTML.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the "escape" method to correctly escape the ">" character in XML attribute values. This can be done by checking the "inAttribute" flag when encountering the ">" character and escaping it accordingly.
