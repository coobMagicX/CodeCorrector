Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the functionality of the `readBits` method in the `BitInputStream` class. Specifically, the test cases are checking the behavior of reading bits in little-endian order and handling cases where the number of bits to be read causes an overflow.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the overflow issue when the `bitsCachedSize` is greater than or equal to 57. One possible direction for the repair could be to add a condition to check if the `count` is greater than the remaining bits in the cache and handle the overflow accordingly.
