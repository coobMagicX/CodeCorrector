Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the matching of a record type constraint on an object literal.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the `matchConstraint` method to handle the case where the constraint object is a record type. The method should iterate over each property on the record and try to match properties on the object.
