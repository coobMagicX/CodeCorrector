Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to ensure that the DocumentType constructor can handle different types of invalid doctypes.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the case where the doctype is empty. The source code should be modified to handle this scenario and avoid throwing an invalid name exception.
