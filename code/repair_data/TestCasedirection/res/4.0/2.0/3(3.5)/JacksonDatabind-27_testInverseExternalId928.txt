Intent: The purpose of the failing test cases is to verify the deserialization of an object using property-based deserialization with external type id.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to ensure that the deserialization works correctly even when the order of the properties in the JSON input is different. This can be done by modifying the logic in the deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithExternalTypeId method to handle the case when the "class" property is encountered before the "payload" property.
