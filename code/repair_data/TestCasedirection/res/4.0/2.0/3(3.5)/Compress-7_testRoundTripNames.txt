Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the correctness of the `parseName` method by checking if it can correctly parse various input names.

Repair strategy: The source code fails to handle certain characters correctly, resulting in the test case failure. The repair direction is to modify the code to handle special characters properly, such as the character 'Â±' in the failed test case.
