Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the correctness of the Base64 encoder.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue that causes the `assertTrue` assertion to fail. This could involve investigating the implementation of the `Base64` encoder and identifying any potential errors or incorrect behavior.
