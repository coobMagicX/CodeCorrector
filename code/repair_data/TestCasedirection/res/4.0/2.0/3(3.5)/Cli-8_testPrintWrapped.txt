Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the correctness of the renderWrappedText() method in the source code. The test cases check the behavior of the method when wrapping text within a specified width and adding padding to subsequent lines.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly wrap the text and add padding to subsequent lines according to the given width and tab stop. The repair strategy should focus on fixing the logic for finding the wrap position and padding the subsequent lines correctly.
