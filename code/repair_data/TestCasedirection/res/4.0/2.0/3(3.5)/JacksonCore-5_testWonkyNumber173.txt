Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the JsonPointer class when compiling a pointer with a wonky number (in this case, "/1e0").

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to modify the implementation of the `_parseIndex` method in the source code to correctly handle wonky numbers. Currently, the method returns -1 for any input with a length of 0 or more than 10 characters. Additionally, it checks if the length is exactly 10 and tries to parse the number as a long. The repair direction should involve updating the `_parseIndex` method to handle wonky numbers correctly, allowing the test case to pass.
