Intent: The purpose of the failed test case is to test if the "renderWrappedText" method in the HelpFormatter class correctly wraps a given text string at the specified width.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the logic in the "findWrapPos" method so that it correctly identifies the position to wrap the text at. Currently, the method is not correctly handling the case where there are no whitespace characters within the specified width.
