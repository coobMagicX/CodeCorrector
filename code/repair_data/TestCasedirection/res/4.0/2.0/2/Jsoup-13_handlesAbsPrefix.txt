Intent: The test case "handlesAbsPrefix" is intended to check if the method `hasAttr` can correctly identify when an attribute, particularly an absolute path attribute (abs:href), is present in an HTML element.

Repair strategy: Modify the `hasAttr` method to correctly handle and recognize absolute path attributes such as "abs:href". This might involve enhancing the underlying attribute checking logic (`attributes.hasKey(attributeKey)`) to consider both regular and absolute path attributes, ensuring it can accurately determine the presence of dynamically generated attributes like "abs:href".
