Intent:
The test case `testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldNameChars` is intended to verify that the method `writeValue` fails or handles errors correctly when attempting to write a string that does not consist of valid field name characters. This test checks the robustness and error handling of the function when faced with invalid input in a specific context, likely when the writer is expected to write field names (possibly in an object).

Repair strategy:
To address the failure indicated by this test case, the error handling or validation logic in the `writeValue` method (or related methods) needs enhancement to explicitly check for and reject invalid field name characters when `_type` is set to `TYPE_OBJECT` and `_gotName` is false. This involves adding checks before accepting input as a valid field name or throwing an appropriate error if the input does not meet the criteria for field names. This could be done by either:
1. Enhancing the `_testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldName` method to correctly simulate the scenario and ensure it triggers the necessary validation in `writeValue`.
2. Modifying `writeValue` to include a validation step that checks the format of the string against expected field name characters when writing to an object-type context.
