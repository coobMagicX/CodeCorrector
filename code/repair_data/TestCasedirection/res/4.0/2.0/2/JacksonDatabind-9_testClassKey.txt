Intent: The test `testClassKey()` is intended to serialize a `Map` where keys are of type `Class<?>` and verify that the class type is serialized into its canonical name form (e.g., `java.lang.String`) in the resultant JSON string.

Repair strategy: Modify the `serialize` method to handle cases where the `value` is of type `Class<?>`. Implement logic to convert the class type into its canonical name string when encountered as a key in the map before serialization. This should include checking if `value` is an instance of `Class<?>` and then using `((Class<?>) value).getCanonicalName()` for serialization. This change will ensure that class keys are correctly transformed into their string representation suitable for JSON keys.
