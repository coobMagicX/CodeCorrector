Intent: The test case `testEmpty1256` is intended to serialize an instance of `Issue1256Bean` with the `NON_ABSENT` inclusion setting, which should result in an empty JSON object `{}` if all properties of `Issue1256Bean` are either null or absent (like Optional.empty() in Java 8).

Repair strategy: Investigate how the `BeanPropertyWriter` handles the `NON_ABSENT` inclusion setting. Ensure that for properties with values equivalent to 'absent' (like Java Optional.empty or similar constructs), the property is not serialized, and that the overall serialization respects this setting across all properties of `Issue1256Bean`. If properties are incorrectly serialized when they should be considered absent, adjust the condition checking and handling inside the `BeanPropertyWriter` for `NON_ABSENT` to correctly identify and suppress absent properties. This may involve refining the logic that determines whether a property value is 'absent' and ensuring that these values are not written to the JSON output.
