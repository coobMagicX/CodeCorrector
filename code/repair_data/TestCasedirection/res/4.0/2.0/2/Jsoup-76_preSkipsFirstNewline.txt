Intent: The test case `preSkipsFirstNewline` is designed to verify that the HTML parser handles the `<pre>` tag correctly by skipping the first newline immediately following the opening `<pre>` tag, but preserves subsequent newlines within the tag. It also checks that the retrieved whole text from the `<pre>` tag includes the newline characters correctly.

Repair strategy: Adjust the parsing logic for the `<pre>` tag to ensure that the first newline character immediately after the opening tag is ignored, but all subsequent content, including newline characters, is processed accurately. This might involve modifying the tokenizer or parser state when a `<pre>` tag is encountered, to skip processing of the first newline character, while ensuring remaining content is handled without alteration. Additionally, ensure that the `wholeText` method accurately reflects the raw content within the `<pre>` element, including any skipped newlines as per the specification for the `<pre>` tag.
