Intent: The purpose of the test case `testMissingRequiredOptions` is to validate whether the method `checkRequiredOptions` correctly identifies when a required option is not provided in the command line arguments and throws a `MissingOptionException` with an appropriate message listing all missing required options.

Repair strategy: From the failure in the test case, it is evident that the error message generated by the `checkRequiredOptions` method does not match the expected output "Missing required options: b, c". The source code should be revised to correctly format the error message by including all missing required options, separated by commas if there are multiple. The method needs to handle multiple missing options more gracefully, ensuring that all are listed in a clear, comma-separated format in the message. Adjustments should be made to ensure that the output string is constructed accurately, reflecting all required but missing options.
