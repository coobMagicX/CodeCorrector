Intent:
The test case 'hasAbsAttr' is designed to verify that the method `hasAttr` correctly identifies when HTML elements have an absolute URL in their 'href' attribute. It checks the functionality for elements with both relative and absolute URLs, and for collections of elements.

Repair strategy:
The repair should focus on enhancing the `hasAttr` method to handle cases where 'abs:href' needs to be recognized and distinguished from regular 'href'. This involves modifying the method to check for absolute URL construction and validation when the attribute key 'abs:href' is passed. This might include integrating URL resolution or a specific condition to handle 'abs:href' differently from other attributes.
