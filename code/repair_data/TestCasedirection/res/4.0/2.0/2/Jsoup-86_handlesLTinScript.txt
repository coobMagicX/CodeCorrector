Intent: The test case `handlesLTinScript` intends to verify that the `Jsoup.parse` method correctly handles pseudo-XML declarations within `<script>` tags when parsing HTML content as XML. Specifically, it checks if characters resembling XML declarations (`<?` and `?>`) within script tags are appropriately converted to comments to maintain the integrity of the script content during XML parsing.

Repair strategy: Modify the `Jsoup.parse` method or adjust the XML parser settings to ensure that text within `<script>` tags is not misinterpreted as XML declarations or instructions. This might involve enhancing the parser's ability to differentiate between content within script tags and actual XML declarations, possibly by implementing context-aware parsing rules that treat content inside script tags as literal text rather than parsing it as potential XML or HTML markup.
