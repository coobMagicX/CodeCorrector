Intent: The intent of the test case `testBinaryEncoder` is to verify that the `Base64` class, when used as a `BinaryEncoder`, correctly encodes binary data into Base64 format. The test iterates over a predefined list of string and byte array pairs, encoding the byte array and comparing the result to the expected Base64-encoded string.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `Base64` class's encode method correctly transforms binary data into the expected Base64 format. Check the implementation of the `encode` method within the `Base64` class to ensure it adheres to the Base64 encoding specification. This could involve debugging how the method processes input bytes and constructs the Base64 output, making sure padding and character mapping are correctly handled.
