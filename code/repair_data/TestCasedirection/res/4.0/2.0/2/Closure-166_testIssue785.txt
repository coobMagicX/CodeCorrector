Intent: The test case `testIssue785` intends to verify that the `out` object is correctly typed as `{prop: (string|undefined)}` after it is passed to function `f` which has a parameter `x` that accepts either a `string` or an object of type `{prop: (string|undefined)}`. The purpose is to ensure that the type inference system correctly updates the type of `out` based on function usage.

Repair strategy: The `matchConstraint` method in the source code needs to be modified to handle constraints that include unions of types (specifically string and object types in this case). The current implementation does not address the scenario where the constraint might be a union type which includes a record type and another type (like `string`). The method should be enhanced to inspect each element of the union to determine if any are record types and process them accordingly. This can involve updating the condition check from `constraint.isRecordType()` to effectively manage union types that include a record type.
