Intent: The intent of the test cases is to verify that the `writeEmbeddedObject` method in the `JsonGenerator` class appropriately handles null inputs by outputting "null" and throws an exception for unsupported object types (like a Class object) while serializing them into JSON.

Repair strategy: Modify the `writeEmbeddedObject` method to correctly handle null inputs by outputting "null" instead of throwing an exception. Ensure that the method only throws an exception for unsupported object types that are not null. This may involve adding a conditional check to differentiate the handling of null values and unsupported types.
