Intent: The intent of the test case `testEscapeBackslash4` is to verify that backslashes in the input are correctly handled and printed as they are when the `CSVPrinter` is configured to use a custom quote character. The test ensures that double backslashes in the input remain unchanged in the output, suggesting that escaping or quoting mechanisms do not modify them improperly.

Repair strategy: Given that the test case fails, it seems that the backslashes are being altered or incorrectly processed by the `printAndQuote` method. To correct this, the source code should be reviewed to ensure that backslashes are not unnecessarily escaped or modified unless required by the CSV format specification. The repair should focus on the conditional logic within the `MINIMAL` case of the `quoteModePolicy` switch statement, ensuring that characters like backslashes are handled according to the CSV format's rules without additional modifications unless explicitly needed. This may involve adjusting the conditions that determine when a character should be quoted or checking how appended characters are handled in the output stream.
