Intent: The test case `testIssue423` aims to verify the functionality of the `findCalledFunctions` method by checking whether it can accurately identify and record function calls within a JavaScript-like structure. The specific case tests if the method can handle JavaScript functions wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) and multiple nested function calls, particularly when dealing with jQuery-style chaining and callbacks.

Repair strategy: To address the failure of test case `testIssue423`, the repair should focus on ensuring that the `findCalledFunctions` method correctly processes and identifies function calls in complex nested structures and function expressions in JavaScript code. This includes:
1. Verifying and possibly modifying how child nodes of type `CALL` are handled, particularly when these calls involve chained or nested function calls.
2. Ensuring that the method can traverse and identify function calls within nested and anonymous functions typically used in JavaScript frameworks like jQuery.
3. Adding additional checks or handling mechanisms for different node types or structures that might not currently be accounted for, such as IIFE or chained method calls.
