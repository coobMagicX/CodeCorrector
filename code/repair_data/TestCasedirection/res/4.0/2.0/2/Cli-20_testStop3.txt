Intent: The testStop3 test case is intended to verify the behavior of the parser when the `stopAtNonOption` flag is set to true. Specifically, it tests whether:
1. Options not defined in the `options` object are not recognized as options.
2. Command line arguments following an unrecognized option are treated as non-option arguments if `stopAtNonOption` is true.
3. The correct number of non-option arguments is returned.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle cases where `stopAtNonOption` is set to true. Specifically:
1. When an unrecognized option is encountered, and `stopAtNonOption` is true, all subsequent tokens should be treated as non-option arguments.
2. The parsing should stop considering any subsequent tokens as potential options once an unrecognized token is encountered with `stopAtNonOption` set to true.
3. Ensure the `tokens` collection is properly handling and collecting all non-recognized options and subsequent arguments as non-option arguments.
4. Review and possibly correct the handling of tokens with "=" especially when they are not recognized as valid options (`hasOption` returns false).
