Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the serialization behavior of date objects in JSON output, specifically ensuring that dates are serialized correctly according to various configurations set via `@JsonFormat` and `SerializationFeature`. The test cases aim to check if the correct format (timestamp or string) and details (like pattern, locale, and timezone) are applied during serialization.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to correctly handle the case where `@JsonFormat.Shape` is set to `ANY`, but a specific pattern, locale, or timezone is provided. The current implementation likely does not consider this combination, leading to incorrect serialization output. The repair should ensure that even if `Shape` is `ANY`, the presence of a specific pattern, locale, or timezone should override the default serialization settings provided by `SerializationFeature`. This might involve modifying the condition checks in the `createContextual` method to properly evaluate and apply these attributes when present, regardless of the shape specified.
