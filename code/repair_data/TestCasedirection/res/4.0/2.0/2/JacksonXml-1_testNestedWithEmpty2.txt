Intent: The test case `testNestedWithEmpty2` is intended to verify that the XML parsing correctly interprets a nested structure within the XML document where an element (`VehicleActivity`) is expected to be present but empty. The test checks if the `VehicleActivity` element is correctly parsed as existing but empty, and that it is accounted for in the resulting data structure.

Repair strategy: Inspect the logic handling XML end elements (`XML_END_ELEMENT`) within the `nextToken` method, particularly handling cases where elements are empty (no content between start and end tags). The parsing code should ensure that an empty element like `<VehicleActivity></VehicleActivity>` translates into a representation that recognizes the presence of an empty object or array, depending on the expected data structure. Consider adjusting the handling of `XML_TEXT` and `XML_END_ELEMENT` to correctly push empty elements into their respective collections or objects. Also, ensure that the `isEmpty` method (or similar logic) effectively identifies empty or whitespace-only text nodes and handles them according to the context (object or array).
