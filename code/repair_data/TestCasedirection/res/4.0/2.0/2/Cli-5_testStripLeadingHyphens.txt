Intent: The test case intends to verify that the `stripLeadingHyphens` method correctly handles a `null` input by returning `null`.

Repair strategy: Modify the `stripLeadingHyphens` method to include a check for `null` input at the beginning of the method. If the input is `null`, the method should immediately return `null`. This will handle the case where `null` is passed to the method, preventing any `NullPointerException` from being thrown and aligning with the expected behavior described in the failed test case.
