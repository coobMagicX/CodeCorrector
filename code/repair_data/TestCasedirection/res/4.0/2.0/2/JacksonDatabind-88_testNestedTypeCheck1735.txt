Intent: The purpose of the test `testNestedTypeCheck1735` is to verify that the deserialization process correctly handles nested type information and checks for subtype compatibility. The test ensures that the system throws an error when trying to deserialize a type that is not a compatible subtype of the expected base type.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a validation step to check if the constructed type from the type identifier is a subtype of the expected base type (`_baseType`). This validation should occur after the type is constructed from the canonical identifier or after it is specialized from the base type and class found. If the validation fails, the code should throw an appropriate exception indicating the subtype mismatch. This can be achieved by enhancing the `_typeFromId` method to include a subtype compatibility check before returning the constructed `JavaType`.
