Intent: The test `littleEndianWithOverflow` intends to verify the correct reading of bits from a stream in the Little Endian byte order, including scenarios where the number of bits read accumulates to a size that could potentially cause overflow problems in the buffer logic.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on the mechanism handling the accumulation and shifting of bits in the buffer (`bitsCached`), particularly when `bitsCachedSize` becomes large enough to be susceptible to overflow (i.e., when performing operations that extend beyond the buffer's current capacity). The code should be adjusted to ensure that no data loss or incorrect bit shifting occurs when `bitsCachedSize` is near or exceeds the size at which integer overflow would occur (typically around 64 bits for a long in Java). This might involve implementing a check or a different handling strategy when `bitsCachedSize` reaches a critical size. Also, ensure that the logic correctly handles the transition between reading consecutive bytes, especially when the buffer is nearly full but requires more bits to satisfy the `readBits(count)` request.
