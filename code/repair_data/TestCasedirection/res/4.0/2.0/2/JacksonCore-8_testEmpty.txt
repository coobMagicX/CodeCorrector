Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testEmpty()` is to verify that the `TextBuffer` class correctly handles and returns an empty buffer. The test checks if the length of the buffer is zero after initializing the `TextBuffer` with an empty buffer and even after some operations like `contentsAsString()`.

Repair strategy: The issue likely arises from not properly resetting internal state or handling empty states in the `TextBuffer` class methods. The repair should focus on ensuring:
1. The `resetWithEmpty()` method correctly initializes `_inputBuffer`, `_resultArray`, `_resultString`, and related flags such as `_inputStart` and `_hasSegments`.
2. The method `getTextBuffer()` should return an empty array or correctly handle zero-length states when the buffer is initialized as empty or reset to an empty state.
3. Make sure that any modifications to the buffer (like `contentsAsString()`) do not alter the intended empty state of the buffer unless explicitly supposed to.
4. Implement and check for consistency in the handling of the buffer's state across various methods to ensure that the buffer remains empty after any operations, if it was initially empty.
