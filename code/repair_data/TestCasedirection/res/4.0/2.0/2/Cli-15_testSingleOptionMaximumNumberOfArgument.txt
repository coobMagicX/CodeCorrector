Intent: The test case is intended to verify that when a command line option ("-b") is provided with fewer arguments than its maximum limit, the missing arguments are filled with the default values in the order they were added until the maximum number of arguments is reached.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to ensure that when retrieving values for an option, if the number of supplied arguments is less than the maximum defined, the additional default values should be appended to the list of values until the maximum is reached. This should be done in the order of the defaults provided, stopping when the maximum count is achieved.
