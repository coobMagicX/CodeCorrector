Intent:
The intent of the test case `testBase64EmptyInputStream` is to verify that the `encode` method correctly handles the encoding of an empty input stream. This test checks both byte-by-byte processing and chunk-based processing with a specified line length and line separator.

Repair strategy:
Review and ensure that the `encode` method correctly interprets an empty input (`inAvail == 0`) without processing further or resizing buffers unnecessarily. If `inAvail` is zero, the method should immediately mark the end of the file (`eof`) or return without altering the state or output buffer. This involves possibly adjusting conditions to handle zero-length inputs explicitly, ensuring that no further processing (like resizing the buffer or changing the modulus) occurs when there is no data to process.
