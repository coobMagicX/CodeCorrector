Intent:
The test case `testSimple` is intended to verify the serialization and deserialization process of a `Company` object that contains a list of different types of computers (`DesktopComputer` and `LaptopComputer`). The test aims to ensure that after serializing a `Company` object to JSON and subsequently deserializing it back to an object, the integrity and the size of the list of computers within the `Company` object remain consistent.

Repair strategy:
Given the fault revealed on the line where `readValue` is used to deserialize the JSON back to a `Company` class, the source code likely fails to correctly handle different types or subtypes of `Computer` during deserialization. The repair should focus on ensuring that the custom deserialization logic in `_deserialize` correctly recognizes and processes the various subtypes of `Computer` within the JSON. This may include:
1. Verifying and possibly adjusting the logic within `_deserializeWithNativeTypeId` to handle different computer subtypes correctly.
2. Ensuring that the type information for each subtype is correctly included in the JSON and subsequently used to properly instantiate the respective subtype during deserialization.
3. Reviewing and adjusting how type ids are merged and handled in the deserialization process, particularly when `_typeIdVisible` is true, to ensure type information is preserved and correctly parsed.
4. Confirming that the `_findDeserializer` method appropriately retrieves a deserializer that can handle the specific subtypes based on the type id. This might involve configuring the `ObjectMapper` or ensuring it has the necessary type information to handle polymorphic types.
