Intent: The intent of the `bigEndianWithOverflow` test case is to verify the `readBits` function for handling large bit reads in a big-endian byte order, particularly testing the function's ability to handle bit overflow conditions effectively when the number of bits requested approaches or exceeds the size that can be handled without overflow.

Repair strategy: Modify the `readBits` function to properly manage the bit overflow condition in big-endian mode. This includes ensuring that when shifting operations are performed, they do not inadvertently discard or corrupt significant bits due to exceeding the datatype limits. Implement checks or adjustments in the bit-shifting logic to prevent loss of data and ensure that the values are correctly computed and returned, especially when `bitsCachedSize` gets close to the `MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE`. Consider using a more robust method to handle the accumulation and extraction of bits that scales safely with larger bit sizes.
