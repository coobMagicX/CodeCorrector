Intent: The test case `testTokensSingleMatchWithPath` aims to verify that the `FilteringParserDelegate` correctly filters and returns JSON tokens based on specific field names ("value" in this case) while maintaining correct parsing of the JSON structure, including proper handling of JSON objects and arrays with the inclusion of paths.

Repair strategy: It appears that the program may not be handling transitions between JSON object contexts correctly, particularly when ending an object. The failure at the line `assertToken(JsonToken.END_OBJECT, p.nextToken());` suggests that the method `nextToken()` may either prematurely end an object or fail to recognize the end of an object. The source code should be adjusted to ensure that:
1. The transition states between JSON tokens (especially between `FIELD_NAME`, `VALUE_NUMBER_INT`, and `END_OBJECT`) are managed correctly.
2. The context handling (`_headContext`, `_itemFilter`) is correctly updated and verified at each step.
3. Handling of nested structures is properly synchronized with token filtering and path inclusion settings. This might involve refining the logic that checks and updates context states (`_headContext`, `_exposedContext`) or ensuring that token transitions are correctly identified and processed.
