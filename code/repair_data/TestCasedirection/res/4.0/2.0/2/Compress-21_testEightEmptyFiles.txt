Intent: The test case `testEightEmptyFiles()` aims to verify that the `writeBits` method correctly handles the scenario where it is supposed to write a sequence of zero bits for eight separate instances (perhaps representing empty files or data streams).

Repair strategy: The source code should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that it can handle cases where the number of bits (`length`) is zero. This involves:
1. Checking if the method unnecessarily writes data when `length` is zero.
2. Ensuring that no output operation is performed when there are no bits to write, i.e., when `length` equals zero, the method should effectively perform no operation and not write any residual or unintended data to the output. This might involve adding a condition to skip the writing process if `length` is zero.
