Intent: The purpose of the test cases is to ensure that the function definitions inside conditional statements (such as `if` statements) are correctly printed with braces `{}`. This is important for compatibility with Safari, which may not correctly parse function statements inside conditionals without explicit block scoping.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` method or the related printing logic to check if a function or `do` statement is directly inside an `if` statement (or similar control flow structures) without an enclosing block `{}`. If it is, the output should automatically wrap the function or `do` statement in braces to ensure it adheres to the expected syntax in environments like Safari. The code should be adjusted to detect and handle these scenarios by inserting the necessary block braces around the function or `do` statement when printing.
