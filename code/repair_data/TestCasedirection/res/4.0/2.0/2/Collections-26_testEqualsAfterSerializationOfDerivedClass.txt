Intent: The purpose of the test case "testEqualsAfterSerializationOfDerivedClass" is to verify that the serialization and deserialization process preserves the integrity of the `DerivedMultiKey` object's hash code. It ensures that the hash code of an object remains consistent before and after serialization, which is crucial for correctly identifying objects in collections such as hash sets or hash maps even after they are serialized and deserialized.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the `readResolve()` method in the `DerivedMultiKey` class or its superclass properly recalculates or restores the hash code after deserialization. This may involve modifying the `readResolve()` method to correctly recompute the hash code based on the keys stored in the deserialized object. Alternatively, if the hash code is computed once and stored, ensure that this stored hash value is also correctly serialized and deserialized along with the object.
