Intent: The test case `testNegativeZero()` is intended to verify that the JsonReader correctly recognizes and reads the string representation of a negative zero ("-0") from a JSON array.

Repair strategy: Adjust the source code in the `peekNumber()` method to correctly handle and return the string "-0" when encountered. This involves modifying the part of the method where numerical values are processed to ensure "-0" is treated distinctly from "0" and correctly identified as a valid numeric input. The logic that determines when to output `PEEKED_LONG` or `PEEKED_NUMBER` should be checked and potentially adapted to handle this edge case, allowing the correct processing of negative zero as a string.
