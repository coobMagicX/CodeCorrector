Intent: The test case `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is intended to verify that the `ZipArchiveInputStream` correctly reads the first entry from a zip file and checks both the size of the entry and the exact data it contains.

Repair strategy: Investigate the handling of zip entry data extraction within the `ZipArchiveInputStream` class. Ensure that it properly reads and returns the correct bytes corresponding to each entry in the zip file, particularly when entries are stored without compression. This could involve checking how the input stream is managed and verifying that no data is lost or misinterpreted during the reading process, especially if the entry uses a data descriptor. Consider also validating the implementation of `getNextZipEntry` and its interaction with the input stream buffer.
