Intent: The test case `normalizesDiscordantTags` is intended to verify that the HTML parser correctly normalizes mismatched (case-sensitive) HTML tag names during parsing. Tags like `<div>` and `</DIV>` should be recognized as matching start and end tags, and the document should be parsed accordingly, ensuring that tags are closed properly and nested correctly.

Repair strategy: The likely issue is that the HTML parser does not handle case insensitivity in tag names effectively within the `popStackToClose` method. This method should be adjusted to compare tag names in a case-insensitive manner. Modify the condition `next.nodeName().equals(elName)` to perform a case-insensitive comparison, such as `next.nodeName().equalsIgnoreCase(elName)`. This change will ensure that the parser recognizes `<div>` and `</DIV>` as matching tags, which should resolve the error demonstrated by the test case.
