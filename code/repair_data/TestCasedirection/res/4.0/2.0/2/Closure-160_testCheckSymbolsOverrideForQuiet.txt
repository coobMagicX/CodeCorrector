Intent: The test case `testCheckSymbolsOverrideForQuiet` is intended to verify that the compiler correctly handles the scenario where warnings for undefined variables are treated as errors, even when the overall warning level is set to QUIET. This test ensures that the specific error for undefined variables (`VarCheck.UNDEFINED_VAR_ERROR`) is being enforced despite a general setting that aims to reduce verbosity.

Repair strategy: Examine and potentially modify the handling of warning and error levels in the `initOptions` method, ensuring that specific settings like `--jscomp_error=undefinedVars` correctly override more general settings like `--warning_level=QUIET`. The logic that merges or prioritizes these settings may need to be adjusted to ensure that specific directives (`--jscomp_error`) have precedence over general warning level settings. This might involve refining how the `WarningsGuard` is composed or how individual checks are enabled in the presence of conflicting settings.
