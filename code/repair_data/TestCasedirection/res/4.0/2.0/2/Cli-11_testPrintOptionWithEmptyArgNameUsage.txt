Intent: The intent of the test case `testPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage` is to verify that the usage information for an option with an empty argument name is printed correctly. Specifically, it checks that if an option requires an argument but the argument name is empty, the usage information should not include angle brackets or an argument placeholder.

Repair strategy: Modify the `appendOption` method to handle the case where an option's argument name is empty. Currently, it always includes angle brackets "<>" around the argument name if `hasArg()` returns true and `getArgName()` is not null. You need to add a condition to check whether `getArgName()` is an empty string and skip appending the angle brackets and argument placeholder in such cases. This will help ensure that the usage information is formatted correctly for options with empty argument names.
