Intent: The purpose of the test `testDisappearingMixins515` is to evaluate the serialization behavior of Jackson's ObjectMapper when configured with specific `MapperFeature` settings and a mixin is applied to a class. The test checks if mixins are correctly applied and if the serialization output matches the expected JSON string, indicating that the mixin's annotations or method overrides are effectively modifying the serialization process.

Repair strategy: Since the test case fails at the point where the expected JSON output does not match the actual output, the issue likely lies in either the mixin handling within the `_addMethodMixIns` method or the configuration of the `ObjectMapper`. The repair should focus on ensuring that the mixin methods are correctly recognized and applied over the target class methods. This includes verifying that:
1. The method `_isIncludableMemberMethod` accurately filters out non-eligible methods.
2. The `_addMixUnders` method effectively adds mixin methods under the corresponding annotated methods of the target class.
3. The mixin methods are not being ignored or overwritten unintentionally due to the method resolution order or incorrect handling of method visibility and precedence.
4. The settings of the `ObjectMapper` are correctly interacting with the mixins, particularly checking if disabling certain `MapperFeature`s like `INFER_PROPERTY_MUTATORS` might be impacting the mixin integration.
   
The repair should particularly look into how the mixin methods are prioritized against existing methods in the target class and ensure that the serialization process respects these mixin overrides or additions as expected by the test case.
