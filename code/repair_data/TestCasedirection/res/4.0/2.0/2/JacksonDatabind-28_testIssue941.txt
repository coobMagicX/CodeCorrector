Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue941` is to ensure that the JSON serialization and deserialization processes are working correctly, both for generic `ObjectNode` and specific custom class `MyValue`. The test aims to validate that an empty JSON object can be properly serialized from an `ObjectNode` and then deserialized back into both an `ObjectNode` and a custom class `MyValue`.

Repair strategy: The failure in deserializing into the custom class `MyValue` suggests a potential issue with the `deserialize` method not handling or supporting the conversion to custom types correctly, or that the `MyValue` class lacks proper configuration or annotations to guide the deserialization process. The key directions for repair could involve:
1. Ensuring that the `MyValue` class has the necessary Jackson annotations if required, to guide the deserialization process.
2. Modifying the `deserialize` method or creating a custom deserializer for `MyValue` to handle specific deserialization logic needed by `MyValue`.
3. Reviewing and possibly enhancing the `MyValue` class to ensure it can be instantiated and populated from a JSON structure correctly, including adding a no-argument constructor if absent and ensuring fields are accessible or correctly annotated.
