Intent: The source code is intended to parse a byte array representing an octal number, starting from a specified offset and for a specified length, while handling leading zeros, spaces, and ensuring that the number is within octal number range (0-7). It should also handle and throw exceptions for various invalid conditions such as unexpected characters or improper termination of the octal number sequence.

Repair strategy: To address the failing test cases, enhancements in validation and error handling are necessary. Specifically:
1. Introduce checks to ensure the input byte array meets a minimum length requirement before attempting to parse it, as indicated by the test case expecting an exception when the array is too short.
2. Confirm and enforce the requirement that the octal number must end with a space or NUL byte to validate its termination correctly. Add explicit checks for this condition.
3. Augment the parsing logic to handle and throw exceptions for embedded invalid characters like NUL within the octal number itself unless these are at the end, and ensure spaces are not embedded within the number.
4. Refine the logic to better distinguish between padding (leading zeros and spaces) and the actual octal numbers, ensuring that transitions between these are handled without misinterpretation.
5. Adjust error messaging to provide more specific feedback based on the type of input error (e.g., "Invalid input - embedded space", "Invalid input - embedded NUL", etc.), aligning with what the test cases expect.
