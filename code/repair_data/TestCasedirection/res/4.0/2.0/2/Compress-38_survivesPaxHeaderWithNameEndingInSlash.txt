Intent: The intent of the test `survivesPaxHeaderWithNameEndingInSlash` is to verify that the TarArchiveInputStream can correctly read entries from a TAR file, particularly handling the PAX header format, and ensuring that entries with names ending in a slash are processed correctly. The test checks if the entry name is as expected and that there are no further entries after the specified one.

Repair strategy: The problem seems to lie in the handling of TarArchiveEntry objects, possibly in the method `getNextTarEntry()` or related to how entries are being parsed or identified in the stream, especially those with names ending in a slash. To repair, ensure that the `getNextTarEntry()` method correctly parses entries and accurately reflects end-of-archive status. This might involve debugging the method to handle PAX headers and entry terminations correctly. Check if the method misinterprets the file structure or mishandles the stream's end, leading to incorrect or unexpected retrieval of entries.
