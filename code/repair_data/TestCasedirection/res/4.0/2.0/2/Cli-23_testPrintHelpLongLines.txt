Intent: The intent of the test `testPrintHelpLongLines` is to verify that the help text for command line options is correctly formatted and wrapped according to specified width constraints when displayed on the console or in documentation. This ensures that users can read and understand the available options and their descriptions clearly without line overflow issues.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the `renderWrappedText` method to handle edge cases where text wrapping incorrectly calculates the position to wrap text, potentially causing infinite loops or improper line breaks. Specifically, ensure that the `findWrapPos` function correctly accounts for additional padding introduced by `nextLineTabStop` and any special characters or formatting in option descriptions. Also, verify the logic that prevents infinite loops when the wrap position `pos` does not change between iterations, suggesting a potential misalignment with the expected width and actual rendered characters.
