Intent: The test case `testCodec98NPE` is intended to verify that the `Base64OutputStream` can handle Base64 decoding correctly without causing a NullPointerException, especially when dealing with input that fills the buffer and requires proper closing of the stream.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure proper handling of buffer resizing and ensure that buffer is not null or improperly accessed when the stream is closed. The probable cause of the NullPointerException could be an attempt to access or modify the buffer in the `stream.close()` method when it is not properly initialized or has been set to null. Ensure that closing the stream properly flushes the remaining data into the buffer, handles any remaining bytes that need to be decoded, and correctly finalizes the buffer handling without leaving it in an inconsistent or null state.
