Intent: The test case `testSkipValue_emptyJsonObject()` is designed to ensure that the `skipValue()` method correctly handles the scenario where it is called on an empty JSON object. The expectation is that after skipping, the JSON reader should correctly identify the end of the document, signifying that there are no more tokens to read.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `skipValue()` does not correctly handle cases where the JSON object is empty. In this scenario, the method should directly check if the JSON object is empty and adjust the internal state to reflect that the end of the document has been reached. The repair should involve adding a condition at the beginning of the `skipValue()` method to handle the case where the stack is at its initial size (indicating an empty document or object) and directly set the current token to `JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT`, or appropriately manage the stack to reflect this state.
