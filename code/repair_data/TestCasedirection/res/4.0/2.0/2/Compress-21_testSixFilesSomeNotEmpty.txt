Intent: The test case `testSixFilesSomeNotEmpty` appears to be testing the functionality of a compression or file handling method, specifically focusing on a scenario where there are six files and two of them are not empty. The intent is to ensure that the method correctly handles multiple files with varying content states.

Repair strategy: Given the fault-revealing line `testCompress252(6, 2)`, and without specific details of errors thrown, it is likely that the issue might relate to improper handling of bit manipulation or incorrect final byte writing when the total number of bits does not align perfectly with byte boundaries (i.e., is not a multiple of 8). The repair should focus on verifying and potentially modifying the logic within the `writeBits` method:
1. Check the condition `if (shift == 0)` to make sure that it correctly resets the shift and writes the cache to the header, ensuring it handles all bits, especially the last few bits correctly.
2. Ensure that the final byte is correctly handled when `shift > 0` after the loop. This condition might not be writing the necessary remaining bits if the total bit count isn't a multiple of 8, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
3. Adding unit tests to simulate the exact scenario of the failed test case, focusing on different numbers and states of files, can provide more insight into how the method behaves with such inputs, thereby improving its robustness and reliability.
