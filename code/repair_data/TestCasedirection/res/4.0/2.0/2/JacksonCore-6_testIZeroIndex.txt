Intent: The test case `testIZeroIndex` is designed to check the functionality of the `_parseIndex` method when handling edge cases related to zero in the input string. It ensures that a single zero (`"0"`) is correctly parsed as an index `0`, and a string with leading zeros (`"00"`) returns `-1` because leading zeros are not allowed.

Repair strategy: The source code should be improved to handle the case where the string has leading zeroes more accurately. Currently, the code incorrectly parses `"0"` as a valid index due to the absence of a specific check for leading zeros except for strings longer than 1 character. A proper strategy would involve adding a condition to explicitly reject strings with more than one character where the first character is '0'. Thus, the repair should ensure that any string starting with '0' followed by any other digit should return `-1`.
