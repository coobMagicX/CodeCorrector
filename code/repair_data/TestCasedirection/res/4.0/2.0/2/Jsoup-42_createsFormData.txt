Intent: The test case is designed to validate that the `formData()` method correctly extracts and constructs a list of key-value pairs representing the form data from a given HTML form. It checks whether the method handles different form elements like input (text, radio, checkbox), select, and textarea correctly, considering various attributes such as 'selected', 'checked', and 'disabled'.

Repair strategy: Review and adjust the handling of form elements in the `formData()` method to ensure:
1. Only the selected options in a 'select' element are added unless none are explicitly selected, in which case the first option should be added.
2. 'Checkbox' and 'radio' inputs are only added if they are 'checked'.
3. Elements like 'input' with type 'text' are always added unless they have the 'disabled' attribute.
4. Ensure that multi-selected options in 'select' elements and inputs like checkboxes or radios that are not checked are handled correctly, according to the HTML standards and test case expectations. This may involve refining the selection logic and possibly filtering elements based on their 'disabled' status.
