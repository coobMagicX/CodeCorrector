Intent:
The intent of the test case `testIssue2088UnwrappedFieldsAfterLastCreatorProp` is to validate the correct deserialization of JSON properties into their corresponding Java fields, including handling of nested unwrapped fields. The test checks that properties `x`, `y`, and the nested unwrapped fields `a` and `b` of the object `w` within `Issue2088Bean` are correctly assigned from the JSON input.

Repair strategy:
To address the failing test case, the possible issues in the source code may lie within the handling and assignment of nested unwrapped fields after the last creator property is set. Specifically, the following steps should be investigated and potentially adjusted:

1. **Error Handling during Deserialization**: Ensure that errors during the deserialization of nested properties are correctly caught and handled without breaking the flow or incorrect assignments.

2. **Property Buffering and Assignment Logic**: Review and possibly revise the logic that buffers and assigns properties to the bean, especially after the last creator property is set. This includes ensuring that the properties are not only buffered but also correctly assigned to the correct fields, especially for nested and unwrapped properties.

3. **Unwrapped Property Handling**: The method `_unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped` should be analyzed to ensure that it correctly processes and assigns unwrapped properties. There might be an issue in how the tokens are managed and assigned to the unwrapped properties, which could be causing the misassignment observed in the test case.

4. **Class Type Check**: The condition that checks if `bean.getClass() != _beanType.getRawClass()` could potentially filter out valid scenarios or be incorrectly implemented, leading to situations where valid beans are rejected or not properly handled.

By focusing on these areas, the source code can be adjusted to ensure that all properties, including nested and unwrapped ones, are correctly deserialized and assigned, thus allowing the test case to pass.
