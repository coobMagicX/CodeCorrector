Intent: The test case `testShortWithEqual` is designed to validate that the parser correctly handles short options with an equal sign separating the option and its argument. It should parse the option "-f=bar" such that the option 'f' is identified and its associated value 'bar' is correctly retrieved.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be enhanced to correctly parse and split option arguments that come in the format of "-f=bar". Specifically, the code handling options that start with "-" needs to detect when an "=" is present, and then properly split the option from the value. This can be accomplished by modifying the conditional block that processes options starting with "-" to check for and handle "=" within the option string. This will ensure that both the option and the argument are correctly added to the list of tokens, allowing subsequent processing to accurately recognize the option and its associated argument.
