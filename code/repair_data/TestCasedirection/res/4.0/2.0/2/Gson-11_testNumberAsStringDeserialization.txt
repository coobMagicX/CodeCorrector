Intent: The test case `testNumberAsStringDeserialization` is intended to check if the method can correctly deserialize a JSON formatted number (enclosed in quotes as a string) into a Java `Number` object, and then verify if the integer value of this deserialized number matches the expected integer value.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to appropriately handle and convert JSON strings that represent numerical values into `Number` objects. This involves adjusting the `read` method in the `JsonReader` class to correctly interpret strings that can be parsed into numbers, rather than just handling numbers directly or throwing an exception. The `case NUMBER:` in the switch statement could be expanded or modified to check if a string can be converted to a number, or alternatively, introduce a new case handling for strings that qualify as numeric representations.
