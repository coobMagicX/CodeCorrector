Intent: The purpose of the test case `shouldParseShortOptionWithoutValue` is to verify that the command line parser correctly identifies and separates multiple short options provided in the input array without incorrectly interpreting subsequent options as values for the preceding options.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isShortOption` function to accurately recognize each short option regardless of how they are concatenated or presented in the input. This may involve adjusting the parsing logic to handle cases where multiple short options are combined without spaces (e.g., `-t1 -last`) and ensuring that options are not mistakenly treated as values of other options. The solution should involve refining the condition or the way options are extracted and checked in the `isShortOption` method, possibly requiring a more sophisticated parsing mechanism to correctly delimit options from potential values.
