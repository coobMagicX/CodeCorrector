Intent: The test case `testMixinWithBundles` is intended to verify that the Jackson JSON serialization process correctly applies a mixin to modify the serialization behavior of the `Foo` class. The mixin might be used to change the JSON output format or to include/exclude certain properties during serialization.

Repair strategy: The failure in the test case suggests that the serialized output does not match the expected output, indicating a possible issue with how the mixin is applied or how the serialization is handled. The repair should focus on ensuring that the mixin is correctly configured and applied to the `Foo` class. This may involve checking the `FooMixin` class to ensure it correctly overrides serialization behavior as expected, and verifying that the `ObjectMapper` is properly configured to recognize and utilize the mixin for the `Foo` class during the serialization process. Additionally, verifying any annotation-based configurations that could influence serialization should be considered.
