Intent: The test `testLongWithEqual` aims to verify that the parser correctly processes command line arguments containing long options with arguments specified using an equals sign (`=`), such as `--foo=bar`. The test checks if the parser correctly interprets `--foo=bar` as the option `foo` with the value `bar`.

Repair strategy: The source code should handle splitting arguments of the form `--foo=bar` into two separate tokens: `--foo` and `bar`, allowing the parsing mechanism to correctly recognize and assign the value `bar` to the option `foo`. This can be achieved by enhancing the conditional checks within the `else if (arg.startsWith("-"))` block to detect and appropriately split arguments formatted with `=` when the long option is recognized (`options.hasOption(opt)`). If the option is valid and includes an `=`, the code should split the argument into the option's name and its associated value before adding them to the tokens list. This will ensure that the parser receives the correct format to process options and their values correctly.
