Intent: The intent of the test case `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` is to validate that the `ObjectMapper` can correctly handle and map JSON properties to `Person` class fields in a case-insensitive manner. The test checks if the ObjectMapper configured with `ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES` can successfully deserialize an empty JSON object into a `Person` instance without throwing any errors.

Repair strategy: The failure of this test case suggests that there might be an issue in the `remove` method of the `ObjectMapper` when handling case-insensitive property names. The method `remove` may not be correctly handling the case-insensitivity feature, possibly due to the way it checks property names against the keys. To repair this, ensure that the key comparison in the `remove` method respects the case-insensitivity setting. This could involve modifying the `getPropertyName` method or the way keys are compared (using a case-insensitive comparison mechanism when the feature is enabled). Verify that all parts of the source code that deal with property names correctly implement case-insensitivity as configured by the `MapperFeature.ACCEPT_CASE_INSENSITIVE_PROPERTIES`.
