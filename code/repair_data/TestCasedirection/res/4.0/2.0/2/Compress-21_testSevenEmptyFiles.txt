Intent: The test case `testSevenEmptyFiles()` is intended to verify the functionality of the `writeBits()` method when it is supposed to handle a scenario where it compresses data for 7 empty files. Essentially, it is checking how the method deals with a situation where there is no actual data (0 bits of data) to be written for multiple files.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring the `writeBits()` function correctly handles cases where the `length` of the bits to be written is zero. Currently, the handling of the cache and shift reset might not properly address cases where no bits are actually processed (i.e., `length` is 0). The code should include a condition to bypass operations inside the loop if `length` is zero, preventing any manipulation of the `cache` or `shift` variables and avoiding any write operations. This can prevent potential issues from executing write operations with uninitialized or incorrectly managed states.
