Intent: The test case 'testNotPretty' is intended to validate that the HTML output of a web document does not undergo pretty printing (i.e., it retains original spacing, line breaks, and overall formatting) when the pretty print setting is disabled.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the method which generates the HTML representation of the element (`div.html()` in this case) respects the pretty print settings of the document. If pretty printing is set to false, the method should return the HTML content without altering whitespace or adding additional formatting. The repair should focus on verifying and potentially modifying the `html()` method's handling of text and whitespace under different output settings. This may involve adjustments in how text nodes are serialized in the context of their parent and sibling nodes when pretty printing is disabled.
