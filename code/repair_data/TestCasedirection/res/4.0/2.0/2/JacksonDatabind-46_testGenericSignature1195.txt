Intent: The intent of the test case `testGenericSignature1195` is to verify that the method `getGenericSignature` correctly constructs the generic signature string of Java generic types returned by different methods (`getList`, `getMap`, `getGeneric`). The test ensures that the format matches the expected JVM signature format for generic types.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in the incorrect or incomplete handling of the generic type construction in the method `_classSignature` or `_referencedType.getGenericSignature`. The repair should focus on ensuring that the method `getGenericSignature` in the `_referencedType` object correctly handles and formats complex nested generic types like `AtomicReference<String>`. This may involve adjusting the logic in `_classSignature` to accurately pass on details or in how `_referencedType.getGenericSignature` constructs the appended string, especially ensuring proper handling of nested type parameters and their boundaries.
