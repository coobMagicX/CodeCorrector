Intent: The test case `testISO8601PartialMilliseconds` is designed to verify that the date parser correctly handles ISO8601 formatted date strings with partial milliseconds and timezone information. The parser should correctly interpret milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and other time components according to the provided timezone offsets.

Repair strategy: Modify the date parsing logic to properly handle and interpret date strings with partial milliseconds. This involves ensuring that the parser does not incorrectly append or format milliseconds when the input already includes partial millisecond values. The parser must also correctly adjust the time based on the timezone offset provided in the string. A detailed review of the handling for the colon and non-colon cases in timezone offset, as well as the insertion of milliseconds, is necessary to ensure that the test cases pass. Implement more robust parsing rules or adjustments specifically for inputs where milliseconds are not exactly three digits long.
