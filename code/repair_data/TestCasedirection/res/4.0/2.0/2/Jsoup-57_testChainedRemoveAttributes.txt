Intent: The intent of the test `testChainedRemoveAttributes` is to verify that multiple attributes can be successfully removed from an HTML element using chained method calls. The test checks if all specified attributes are removed, leaving the element with its inner text and no attributes.

Repair strategy: The failing test indicates a potential issue in how the `removeIgnoreCase` method handles concurrent modifications (modification of a collection while iterating over it). The `attributes.remove(attrKey)` operation inside the loop that iterates over the `attributes.keySet()` is likely causing a `ConcurrentModificationException` or incorrect behavior due to the modification of the set while iterating. To resolve this, modify the source code to use an iterator's `remove()` method instead of `attributes.remove(attrKey)` directly in the loop. This approach avoids concurrent modification issues by ensuring that the iterator remains consistent with the underlying collection. Additionally, ensure that all method calls in the chain are correctly linked and affect the same element object (`a`).
