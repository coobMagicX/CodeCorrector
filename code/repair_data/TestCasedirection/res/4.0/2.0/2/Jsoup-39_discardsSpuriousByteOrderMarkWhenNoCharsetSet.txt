Intent: The purpose of this test case is to verify that the parseByteData method correctly discards a Byte Order Mark (BOM) when no specific charset is set by the user, and still accurately parses the HTML document, ensuring the text content and charset are correctly interpreted as UTF-8.

Repair strategy: The code needs to ensure that the BOM, if present, is effectively ignored when parsing the document content. This might involve checking and stripping the BOM at the start of the document content decoding process. Ensure that the BOM stripping logic is correctly implemented and executed before the document parsing takes place, especially when no charset is explicitly provided, defaulting to UTF-8. This will prevent the BOM from being misinterpreted as part of the document content, which seems to be affecting the text extraction and comparison in the test case.
