Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue1107` is to deserialize a JSON string into a Java object structure using Gson, and then verify the nested properties of the resulting object. It specifically tests if a nested complex object (`SmallClass`) within a collection (mapped under `inBig`'s `key`) is correctly instantiated and populated from the JSON string.

Repair strategy: The fault-revealing line indicates that the error may be related to how Gson maps the JSON to the `BigClass` and its nested structures. The repair should focus on ensuring that the `BigClass` and `SmallClass` are correctly annotated or configured to map the JSON structure accurately. This might involve examining and potentially modifying the class definitions of `BigClass` and `SmallClass` to ensure they use the correct Gson annotations (`@SerializedName`, etc.) that match the JSON structure. If the classes are correctly annotated, the issue might lie in how Gson's type resolution is handled in the `getSupertype` function, suggesting a review of how generics are resolved when deserializing nested types.
