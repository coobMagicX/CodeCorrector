Intent:
The test case `testIssue1255` is intended to verify that an instance of a class `Foo` with fields referencing the same object (e.g., `bar1` and `bar2` referencing the same `Bar` object) is correctly serialized to JSON and then deserialized back to a `Foo` instance. The purpose is to ensure that the object graph with shared references is maintained correctly across serialization and deserialization processes.

Repair strategy:
One potential error could be that the `generateId` method in the source code does not handle the identity of shared objects properly during serialization. When `mo.bar1` and `mo.bar2` refer to the same `Bar` object, the serialization process must preserve this sharing, and the deserialization process must reconstruct the `Foo` object such that `result.bar1` and `result.bar2` continue to refer to the same `Bar` object. The key repair direction involves ensuring that the `ObjectMapper` configuration or the `generateId` method correctly manages object identities, particularly handling cases where multiple fields in a serialized object reference the same instance. This might involve modifying how IDs are generated or ensuring that the serialization/deserialization process respects these IDs to re-establish the same object references post deserialization.
