Intent: The intent of the test case `testLocationOffsets` is to validate the correct tracking and updating of parser state, specifically the byte and column offsets in a JSON parser when new input is fed in chunks. This test ensures that the parser accurately tracks the location within the stream, which is crucial for error reporting and data processing in streaming JSON parsing.

Repair strategy: The primary issue indicated by the failing test case seems to be related to miscalculations or mismanagement of the internal state tracking variables (`_currInputProcessed`, `_currInputRowStart`, etc.) within the `feedInput` method. To repair this, one should ensure that these variables are correctly updated when new input chunks are fed into the parser. This includes:
- Correctly adjusting `_currInputProcessed` to reflect the total amount of data processed so far, ensuring it accumulates values across multiple `feedInput` calls.
- Accurately recalculating `_currInputRowStart` to maintain the correct column number across feeds.
- Reviewing the initialization and update conditions for these variables to ensure they behave correctly under various input scenarios, such as different start and end points, and across multiple calls to `feedInput`.
- Adding unit tests to cover a variety of edge cases regarding input chunk boundaries and orders to ensure robustness in the parserâ€™s tracking logic.
