Intent: The test `testCOMPRESS178` intends to validate that the `parseOctal` function properly throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when encountering illegal octal values in a tar archive, which should then propagate up as an `IOException` in the context of reading the archive.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on ensuring that the propagation of exceptions from `parseOctal` to the higher-level tar archive processing logic is correctly implemented. This may involve revising the exception handling within the archive reading methods to properly convert or rethrow `IllegalArgumentException` as an `IOException`, or ensuring that the conditions under which `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown are correctly met by the `parseOctal` function. Adjustments may also be needed in the test to accurately catch and assert the expected exceptions.
