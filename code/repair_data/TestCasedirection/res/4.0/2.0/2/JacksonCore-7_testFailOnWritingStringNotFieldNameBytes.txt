Intent: The test case `testFailOnWritingStringNotFieldNameBytes` aims to verify that the method `writeValue` behaves correctly when attempting to write a string value that is not a field name in the context of JSON object serialization. The test likely checks whether an appropriate exception or error handling is triggered when a string value is written where a field name is expected, particularly in a context where bytes (not characters) are used.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to include a check to ensure that if a string value is being written in the context of an object (`_type == TYPE_OBJECT`), it must be as a field name and not as a value without a preceding field name. This could involve adding a condition to check whether `_gotName` is `true` before allowing a value write, and setting `_gotName` to `false` once a value is written. If `_gotName` is `false` when attempting to write a value, the method should return an error status or throw an exception, thus ensuring that string values are not incorrectly written without associated field names.
