Intent: The test case "createsFormData" checks if the correct form data is generated and collected from a given HTML form. This includes handling various form elements like input (text, radio, checkbox), select, and textarea. It verifies that the form data excludes disabled elements, elements without the 'checked' attribute (for checkboxes and radios), and elements that are not meant to be submitted (like button types).

Repair strategy: The primary issue appears to be with how multiple selected options in a select element are handled. The current implementation might be incorrectly adding multiple selected options without proper validation of whether multiple selections are allowed (e.g., multi-select). Additionally, the test expects checkboxes without explicit values to default to 'on', which needs verification in the code. The repair should include:
1. Adjusting the select element handling to correctly manage single and multiple selections based on specific attributes or the presence of a 'multiple' attribute.
2. Ensuring that checkboxes without a value explicitly set default to 'on' when checked.
3. Review and ensure that the logic correctly excludes non-submit types and disabled inputs consistently with the test expectations.
