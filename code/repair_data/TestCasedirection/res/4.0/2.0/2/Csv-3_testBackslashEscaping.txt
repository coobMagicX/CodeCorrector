Intent: The test case `testBackslashEscaping` is designed to verify the correct handling of escape sequences in a CSV parsing scenario, using a forward slash as the escape character and a single quote for encapsulating strings. This test ensures that special characters like commas, newlines, and the escape character itself can be correctly interpreted and parsed within fields when properly escaped.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly handle different escape sequences based on the escape character specified in the CSV format configuration, which in this case is a forward slash (`/`). The repair should include:
1. Extending the `readEscape()` method to support dynamic recognition and processing of the escape character set in the CSV format, rather than hardcoding for backslashes.
2. Ensuring that all possible escape sequences and combinations therefrom, such as escaped encapsulators, separators, and the escape character itself, are properly recognized and translated.
3. Implementing a mechanism that correctly differentiates between escaped and non-escaped sequences based on context, which might involve updates to the parsing logic that operates on the results of the `readEscape()` method.
