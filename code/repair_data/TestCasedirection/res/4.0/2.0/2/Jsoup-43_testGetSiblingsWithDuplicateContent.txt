Intent: The purpose of the test `testGetSiblingsWithDuplicateContent` is to verify the correct behavior of sibling navigation methods (`nextElementSibling`, `previousElementSibling`, `firstElementSibling`, `lastElementSibling`) in an HTML document parsed by Jsoup. It checks the ability to navigate and retrieve the correct text content of sibling elements, including handling of duplicate content and correct identification of the first and last siblings.

Repair strategy: The potential error in the source code is likely in how sibling elements are being navigated or identified, particularly when duplicates are present or when navigating through multiple sibling elements sequentially. The repair direction should focus on:
1. Ensuring that the methods used for sibling navigation (`nextElementSibling`, etc.) are correctly implemented in the Jsoup library or in any overriding methods that handle sibling navigation.
2. Reviewing the logic that handles the indexing and retrieval of sibling elements in the DOM structure to ensure it correctly accounts for the sequence and uniqueness (or duplication) of sibling elements.
3. Adding or refining logic to handle cases where siblings have duplicate content or tags, ensuring unique identification is maintained where necessary.
