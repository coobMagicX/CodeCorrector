Intent: The test case `testSixEmptyFiles` appears to be designed to verify the ability of the `writeBits` method to correctly handle the scenario where it is supposed to write bits for multiple empty files, which likely implies writing zero bits (i.e., the length of bits to be written is zero).

Repair strategy: The suspected issue in the `writeBits` method lies in its handling of cases where the `length` parameter is zero. The current implementation does not explicitly manage the scenario where no bits should be written due to a zero-length input. The method should be modified to include an early exit or bypass logic when `length` equals zero. This prevents any bit manipulation or write operations when there are no bits to process, thus avoiding potential erroneous writes or manipulations.
