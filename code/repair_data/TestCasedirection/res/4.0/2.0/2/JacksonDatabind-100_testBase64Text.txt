Intent: The test case `testBase64Text()` is designed to verify that binary data can be correctly encoded into a Base64 string using different variants of Base64 encoding, and subsequently decoded back into binary form accurately, ensuring the integrity of both encoding and decoding processes across various data lengths.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to properly handle the conversion of Base64 encoded strings back to byte arrays when the input node is of the type `TextNode`. Currently, the method `getBinaryValue()` in the `TextNode` class does not correctly process the `Base64Variant` parameter, which is necessary for decoding the Base64 encoded string back to binary data. The repair should involve implementing or fixing the logic inside `TextNode.binaryValue()` or in the `getBinaryValue()` method to respect the `Base64Variant` used during encoding, ensuring that the decoding respects the same variant parameters. This will likely involve leveraging the `Base64Variant.decode()` method within the `TextNode` handling to correctly interpret the encoded data according to the specified variant.
