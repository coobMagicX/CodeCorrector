Intent: The intent of the test case `testWithUnwrappedAndCreatorSingleParameterInMiddle` is to verify that the deserialization process correctly handles a JSON object representing a `Person` class with multiple properties, some of which are unwrapped and others that are part of a creator method. The test checks if the JSON fields are accurately mapped to the `Person` class properties including `id`, `name` (which seems to be a composite object of `first_name` and `last_name`), `age`, and `alive` status.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the deserialization logic within the `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` correctly maps and assigns the `age` property from the JSON to the `Person` object's `age` field. This might involve checking the handling and buffering of properties that are not part of the creator properties in the source code. A specific check should be made on how the `age` property is buffered and handled if it does not immediately match a creator property, ensuring it is not being ignored or overwritten in subsequent operations.
