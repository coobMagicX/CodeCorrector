Intent:
The intent of the test case `testCompress197` is to validate the handling of tar archive entries using `TarArchiveInputStream` and ensure that the process does not throw any unexpected IOExceptions during the reading of entries from a tar file. The purpose is to ensure the robustness and correctness of the archive processing logic, especially in handling potentially malformed or special-cased tar files.

Repair strategy:
1. Review the handling of edge cases and special conditions in the `parseOctal` method, which is likely used in processing file permissions or other metadata in the tar entries.
2. Ensure that the `parseOctal` method can correctly handle all valid octal values and appropriately throws errors for invalid data. This involves checking the bounds and conditions, particularly how spaces and null bytes are processed towards the end of the provided buffer.
3. Add detailed logging or error messages within the `parseOctal` method to pinpoint the type of invalid data causing the issue, if the exception message is not descriptive enough.
4. Validate and possibly adjust the logic that determines the start and end points for parsing the octal values in the buffer, ensuring that it accommodates all valid scenarios as expected by the tar file specifications.
5. Consider adding more rigorous checks or preprocessing steps to handle malformed or non-standard tar entries that may be present in "COMPRESS-197.tar", ensuring that the method does not fail silently or throw unhandled exceptions.
