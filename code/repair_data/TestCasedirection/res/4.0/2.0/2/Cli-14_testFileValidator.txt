Intent: The intent of the test case `testFileValidator` is to validate the functionality of parsing and validating command line options where a file name is required. The test aims to verify whether a file option is correctly recognized, parsed, and validated using a specified file validator that confirms the existence of the file.

Repair strategy: The failure indicated at the line `CommandLine cl = parser` suggests an issue with the parsing and validation logic in the `validate` method of the source code. Specifically, the problem may lie in:
1. The `validate` method possibly not handling cases where the expected option (like a file in this case) is provided but does not meet the validation criteria set (e.g., the file does not exist).
2. Incorrect or missing integration between the `parser` object and the `validate` method leading to unsuccessful validation or parsing attempts.

To address this failure, consider:
- Ensuring that the `validate` method correctly checks for the existence of the file when a `FileValidator` is used.
- Reviewing the logic that increments the `present` counter and sets the `unexpected` option to ensure it correctly handles valid options.
- Confirming that the file validator is properly invoked and that its results are correctly interpreted within the context of the `validate` method.
- Adding additional debugging or logging within the `validate` method to trace how options are being processed and validated.
