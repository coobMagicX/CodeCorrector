Intent: The test case `testInvalidSubClass` is designed to ensure that the `createInstance` method of the `DefaultPrettyPrinter` class should throw an `IllegalStateException` if it is called from an instance of an improperly subclassed version of `DefaultPrettyPrinter`, which presumably does not properly override necessary methods or handle specific subclass requirements.

Repair strategy: Modify the `createInstance` method in the `DefaultPrettyPrinter` class to include a check that verifies whether the instance calling the method is of the correct class or has properly overridden necessary methods. If the check fails, the method should throw an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that the method does not properly override required methods. This involves possibly using reflection or a design pattern that enforces proper subclassing.
