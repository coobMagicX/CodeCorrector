Intent: The test case "handlesKnownEmptyNoFrames" is intended to verify the HTML parsing and rendering of a document that includes a self-closing `<noframes>` tag, ensuring that it is correctly parsed and expanded into an open and close tag pair, while maintaining the rest of the document structure intact.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on adjusting the HTML parser in the `Jsoup.parse` method to correctly handle self-closing tags like `<noframes />`. This might involve modifying the parsing logic to ensure that self-closing tags recognized as empty in HTML5 (like `<noframes>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>`) are correctly expanded into a pair of open and close tags in the output HTML. This adjustment ensures the parser maintains compliance with HTML standards regarding self-closing tags.
