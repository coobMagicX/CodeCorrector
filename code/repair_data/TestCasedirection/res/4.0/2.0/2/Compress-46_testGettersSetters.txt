Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to validate that the system properly handles time values that exceed the maximum allowable 32-bit timestamp value by throwing an IllegalArgumentException.

Repair strategy: Modify the code to ensure that the value of the timestamp passed into the `unixTimeToZipLong` method does not exceed the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer. This can be done by adjusting the comparison condition to check if the timestamp is greater than or equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` instead of `TWO_TO_32`, ensuring compatibility with the 32-bit signed integer range.
