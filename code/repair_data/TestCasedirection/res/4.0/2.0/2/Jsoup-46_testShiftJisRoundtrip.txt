Intent: The intent of the test case `testShiftJisRoundtrip` is to verify that HTML content with Shift_JIS encoding is correctly parsed, escaped, and re-encoded without losing or corrupting special characters (such as non-breaking spaces), and without introducing any erroneous characters (such as '?') during the round-trip processing.

Repair strategy: Investigate and ensure that the encoding and decoding processes handle Shift_JIS character set accurately, particularly focusing on special or non-ASCII characters. Modify the `escape` function to better support character encoding and escaping based on the specific charset of the document. This may involve adjusting how the `encoder` interacts with non-ASCII characters and ensuring that the `canEncode` method or equivalent logic effectively checks character compatibility with the specified charset before determining the escaping strategy. Additionally, ensure that the input stream correctly specifies the charset when initializing, perhaps by replacing `Charset.forName("ASCII")` with `Charset.forName("Shift_JIS")` in the test setup to match the intended encoding environment accurately.
