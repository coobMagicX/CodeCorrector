Intent: The purpose of the test case `testUnionOfVariableAndNode` is to ensure that the method `iteratePointers` in the JXPath library can correctly handle and merge the results from a JXPath variable and an XPath node set. It aims to verify that both the variable and the nodes can be iterated over together seamlessly, and the total count of items iterated matches the expected size.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that the `compareNodePointers` method can handle comparisons involving different types of node pointers (e.g., variable pointers and element node pointers) correctly. This includes handling cases where the nodes might not belong to the same document tree or be of the same node type without causing exceptions inappropriately. The repair should include:
1. Adding checks and handling mechanisms in `compareNodePointers` for different types of NodePointers, possibly by introducing type checks or ensuring that comparisons between different types (like a variable and a node) are handled gracefully.
2. Implementing or refining the logic within `compareNodePointers` to manage comparisons where one or both pointers do not relate directly to the XML tree structure (e.g., variables or synthetic nodes).
3. Ensuring that the error handling for pointers not belonging to the same tree does not interfere with valid operations involving XPath expressions that combine variables and actual node sets.
