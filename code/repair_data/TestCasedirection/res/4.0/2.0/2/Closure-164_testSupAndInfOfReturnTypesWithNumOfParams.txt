Intent: The `testSupAndInfOfReturnTypesWithNumOfParams` test case is designed to verify the subtype and supertype relationship between functions with different numbers of parameters. Specifically, it checks if a function with two number parameters (`twoNumbers`) and a function with one number parameter (`oneNumber`) are correctly identified as the least supertype and greatest subtype respectively, under the rules defined in the `isSubtype` method in the source code.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on correctly implementing the subtype checks for functions with different numbers of parameters, ensuring that the subtype rules for optional and required parameters are accurately enforced. This may involve revising the logic in the `isSubtype` method to:
1. Correctly handle cases where the number of parameters differs between the two function types being compared.
2. Potentially introduce a mechanism to distinguish between required and optional parameters explicitly, as the current implementation seems to simplify subtype checks by allowing a function with fewer parameters to be a subtype of a function with more parameters.
3. Ensure that the return types and the variance of parameters (covariant for return types, contravariant for parameter types) are correctly checked according to the type rules specified in the ES4 spec and considering function arity (number of parameters).
