Intent: The intent of the `testMethodInference7` test case is to verify that the type checker correctly handles method override scenarios in a class hierarchy, specifically ensuring that a method in a subclass correctly overrides a method in the superclass even when the parameters of the methods differ. This is to check for the correct handling of function subtyping particularly in the context of parameter covariance and contravariance.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code should focus on correctly handling method overrides where the overriding method in the subclass has more parameters than the method in the superclass. The current implementation in `isSubtype` method should be reviewed to ensure that it adequately checks the compatibility of method signatures in terms of both parameters and return types, taking into account the correct covariance and contravariance rules. The logic dealing with parameter types and 'varArgs' should be meticulously verified and possibly adjusted to handle cases where the overriding method has additional parameters compared to the method it overrides.
