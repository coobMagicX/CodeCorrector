Intent: The test case `testRootBeans()` is designed to verify that the method `readValues()` can correctly parse and map data from various source formats (as indicated by the iteration over multiple `Source` types) into Java objects, ensuring the method handles different data formats correctly.

Repair strategy: The source of the failure might be related to the handling of different data formats in `_dataFormatReaders.findFormat(src, offset, length)`. The strategy should involve:
1. Verifying and enhancing the implementation of `_dataFormatReaders.findFormat()` to ensure it correctly identifies and handles all expected data formats.
2. Adding or improving error handling and logging within `readValues()` to better trace how data formats are being processed and to catch any misconfigurations or unsupported formats.
3. Ensuring that `_testRootBeans(src)` properly sets up the source data in a format that `readValues()` expects, as mismatches here could lead to failures in processing correctly.
