Intent: The test case `testNullCommentEqualsEmptyComment` is designed to verify that a `ZipArchiveEntry` object with a `null` comment is considered equal to another `ZipArchiveEntry` object with an empty comment, given that all other properties are identical.

Repair strategy: Modify the `equals` method to treat `null` comments and empty comments as equivalent. This can be achieved by adjusting the comment comparison logic to equate a `null` string with an empty string before proceeding with other equality checks. This ensures that a `null` comment is treated the same as an empty string for the purposes of determining object equality.
