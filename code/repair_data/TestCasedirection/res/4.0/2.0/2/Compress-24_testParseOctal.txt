Intent: The test case `testParseOctal()` is intended to validate the `parseOctal` method, ensuring it correctly interprets byte arrays representing octal numbers, including handling maximum values, trailing spaces, and nulls, to conform to tar file specifications.

Repair strategy: The `parseOctal` method should correctly parse octal values from a byte array, including correctly handling edge cases involving space and null characters at the end of the array, and managing larger octal values that might be used in specific implementations. The method should also handle cases where the initial byte is zero, returning zero as specified, but still correctly parse sequences that start with zero followed by valid octal digits. The failure points suggest issues with how trailing characters (spaces and nulls) affect the parsing logic, and potentially with how the octal values are calculated or bounds-checked. Adjustments should be made to ensure:
1. Trailing spaces and nulls are correctly identified and excluded from parsing the numeric value.
2. The loop that removes trailing spaces and nulls does not mistakenly decrement the `end` index when the last character is valid.
3. Ensure that the method properly converts sequences that may start with a zero but still contain valid octal digits afterward.
4. Revisit and possibly refactor the logic that throws exceptions for non-octal digits to ensure that all edge cases are handled as expected.
