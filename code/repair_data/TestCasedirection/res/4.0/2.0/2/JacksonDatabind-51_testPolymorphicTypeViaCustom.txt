Intent: The test case aims to verify that the system correctly serializes and then deserializes polymorphic types, preserving the structure and data integrity of the object throughout the process. It checks for non-null values at various points to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted.

Repair strategy: Review the `_findDeserializer` method to ensure it accurately resolves and constructs the correct JavaType for polymorphic and custom types. Specifically, investigate how the method handles type resolution and deserialization of nested polymorphic types. Ensure that the method correctly retains generic type information and resolves the appropriate JavaType based on the type identifier (`typeId`). If necessary, adjust the logic that matches base types and derived types to better accommodate type hierarchy and polymorphism. Make sure that all steps for type resolution, especially around `_baseType` and `_idResolver`, are correctly employed to handle complex scenarios like the one presented in the test.
