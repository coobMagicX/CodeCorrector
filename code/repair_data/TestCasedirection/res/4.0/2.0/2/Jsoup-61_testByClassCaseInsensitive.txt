Intent: The intent of the test case `testByClassCaseInsensitive` is to verify that the method `hasClass` correctly identifies HTML elements with a specified class attribute, irrespective of case-sensitivity. The test checks if the `hasClass` method can handle different cases in the class attribute (`foo`, `Foo`, `FOO`) and matches them correctly against the search query `"Foo"`.

Repair strategy: The `hasClass` method needs to be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure it accurately handles case insensitivity when comparing class names. This could include refining the logic that checks for matching class names within the `class` attribute string, particularly focusing on enhancing the case-insensitive comparison logic in scenarios where class names are separated by whitespace or other characters. Additionally, ensure that the method correctly parses and processes the entire class attribute string, especially when multiple class names are present. This adjustment will help the method to not only compare class names accurately but also manage multiple class names in a single attribute efficiently.
