Intent: The test case `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is designed to verify the parsing of XML attributes into JSON tokens and values using the `nextTextValue` method. The test ensures that the parser correctly identifies XML attribute names as JSON field names and their corresponding values as JSON string values.

Repair strategy: The issue likely stems from the handling of XML attribute names and values in the `nextTextValue` method. The method should correctly return the value of the attribute when the current token is `JsonToken.FIELD_NAME` and the next token represents the attribute value. The method should also update the internal state to reflect the processing of the attribute name and value. A potential repair direction is to adjust the handling of `JsonToken.FIELD_NAME` within the `nextTextValue` method, ensuring that it fetches the correct attribute value when called, and properly transitions to the next token or state, reflecting attribute processing completion. This will allow the parser to return the right values ("7", "9") for XML attributes as expected by the test case.
