Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to validate the `parseOctal` method's ability to correctly parse octal numbers from a byte array. It checks for proper handling of various error conditions, including improper array length, invalid octal characters, and improperly formatted octal strings (embedded spaces or NUL characters).

Repair strategy: Modify the `parseOctal` method to ensure that it correctly handles embedded spaces and NUL characters within the octal number representation after initially skipping leading spaces. The method should either skip over or terminate parsing when encountering NUL or space characters within the number itself, depending on the intended specification for octal parsing in this context. The current handling seems to incorrectly allow trailing NUL or space but does not address similar issues when these characters are embedded within the octal digits. Adjust the logic to either throw an exception or properly ignore these characters during the conversion process from ASCII to the actual octal value.
