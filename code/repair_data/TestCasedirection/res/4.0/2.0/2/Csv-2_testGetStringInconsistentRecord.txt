Intent: The test case `testGetStringInconsistentRecord` is intended to verify that the method `get(String name)` can correctly retrieve a value based on a given header name, assuming that the name and corresponding index exist in a mapping and there is a consistent record with values corresponding to these indices.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `values` array is properly initialized and has a length that is at least equal to the maximum index value in the `mapping` to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. If `values` length is less than the maximum index in `mapping`, modify the method to handle such cases gracefully, possibly by returning `null` or throwing a more descriptive exception if an index is out of the `values` array bounds. Additionally, ensure all necessary initializations and setup are performed before using `recordWithHeader.get("fourth")` in the test, including properly populating the `values` array.
