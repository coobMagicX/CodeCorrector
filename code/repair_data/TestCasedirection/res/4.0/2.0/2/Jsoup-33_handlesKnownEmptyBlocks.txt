Intent:
The test case is designed to verify that the parser correctly handles various self-closing HTML tags, including both known (like `<img>`, `<hr>`, `<script>`, `<div>`, `<a>`, and `<i>`) and unknown (`<foo>`) tags. It tests whether the parser can understand and render self-closing tags in the output HTML correctly, converting them into appropriate closing tags when required by HTML standards.

Repair strategy:
1. Review the handling of self-closing tags in the `insert` method to ensure that it correctly interprets and processes both known and unknown self-closing tags.
2. Modify the implementation to correctly add end tags for known self-closing elements when they are not explicitly provided in the input, and ensure unknown self-closing tags are treated appropriately based on the HTML standards.
3. Ensure that the parser distinguishes between tags that are normally empty and self-closing by specification (like `<img>` and `<hr>`) and those that are not typically self-closing but are marked as such in the input (like `<div>` and `<a>`). Adjust the logic to manage these differences correctly.
4. Confirm that the parser emits end tags for all opening tags that are not self-closed in the input but require closing tags in valid HTML output.
