Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the handling of weird strings in the `readValue` method of the `ObjectMapper` class.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue would involve modifying the implementation of the `deserialize` method to handle the case when the input string is not a valid representation of the target type. This could be done by adding a check for the input string and returning null if it is not a valid representation. Additionally, the exception handling logic for `IllegalArgumentException` and `MalformedURLException` could be improved to provide more informative error messages.
