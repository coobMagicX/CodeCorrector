Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the expandCurrentSegment() method correctly expands the buffer when its length is below the intended maximum.

Repair strategy: To fix the failing test case, the expandCurrentSegment() method needs to be modified to ensure that the buffer is expanded when its length reaches the intended maximum and when it is less than the intended maximum.
