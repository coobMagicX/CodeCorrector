Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the writeBits method when given six empty files.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on identifying any potential errors in the writeBits method that are causing it to fail when processing six empty files. This could include issues with how the cache and shift variables are being used, as well as potential boundary conditions when writing the bits to the header.
