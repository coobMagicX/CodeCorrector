Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the functionality of determining the least supertype and greatest subtype of function types based on their return types and number of parameters.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the implementation of the `isSubtype` method to correctly determine the least supertype and greatest subtype of function types based on their return types and number of parameters. This may involve checking the return types and the number of parameters of the function types and making the necessary comparisons and adjustments to return the correct result.
