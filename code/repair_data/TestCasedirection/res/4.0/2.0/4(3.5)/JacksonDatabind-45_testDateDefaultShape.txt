Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the serialization behavior of Date objects with different configurations of the @JsonFormat annotation.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to handle the serialization of Date objects with different shapes, patterns, locales, and timezones specified in the @JsonFormat annotation correctly. The repair strategy should focus on updating the createContextual() method to consider all the different configurations of the @JsonFormat annotation and serialize the Date objects accordingly.
