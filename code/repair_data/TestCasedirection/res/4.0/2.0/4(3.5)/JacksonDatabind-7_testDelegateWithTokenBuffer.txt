Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the deserialization of a JSON object using a TokenBuffer.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to ensure that the deserialization process correctly starts from the START_OBJECT token. The code should be modified to handle the special case of starting from FIELD_NAME and assume that the START_OBJECT token exists.
