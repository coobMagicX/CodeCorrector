Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the `encode` method when given an empty input stream.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should address the issue with the `encode` method not handling empty input correctly. The method should be modified to handle empty input properly, without causing any errors or unexpected behavior.
