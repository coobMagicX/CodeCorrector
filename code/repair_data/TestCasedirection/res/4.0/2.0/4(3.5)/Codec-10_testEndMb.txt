Intent: The purpose of the failing test cases is to test the encoding of words that end with "mb" using the `caverphone` method. 

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code to pass the test case is to fix the encoding for words that end with "mb". The expected encoding for words that end with "mb" is "M111111111", but the current implementation is not producing the correct encoding.
