Intent: The intent of the test case is to check the serialization of a bean object with a null value for one of its properties.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to handle the serialization of null values correctly for the given test case. This can be done by ensuring that when a null value is encountered, it is serialized as "null" instead of being omitted.
