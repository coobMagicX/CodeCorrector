Intent: The purpose of the "handlesDataOnlyTags" test case is to verify that the parser correctly handles tags that contain only data (e.g., style and script tags).

Repair strategy: The test case is failing because the parser is not correctly handling the data inside the style and script tags. The repair direction would be to investigate and fix the parsing logic for these tags so that the data is correctly extracted and stored.
