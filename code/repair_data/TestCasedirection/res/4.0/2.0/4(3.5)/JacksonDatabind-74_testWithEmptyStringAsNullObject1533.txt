Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that when the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature is enabled, an empty string value is deserialized as a null object.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to update the source code to handle deserializing an empty string value as a null object when the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature is enabled. This can be done by adding a check for an empty string value and setting the corresponding property to null.
