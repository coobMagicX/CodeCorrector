Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the method `parseByteData` correctly parses and returns a document object from a byte buffer containing HTML data.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this failing test case is to fix the method `parseByteData` to handle and discard the spurious byte-order mark (BOM) at the start of the text before parsing the document. This will ensure that the document object contains the expected HTML data and the test case passes.
