Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the parser can correctly parse a short option without a value.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue would involve modifying the implementation of the `isShortOption` method to handle cases where the token contains additional characters after the short option. Currently, the method only checks if the token starts with a "-" and has a length of at least 2, but it does not handle cases where there are additional characters after the short option. Therefore, the repair direction would be to update the `isShortOption` method to handle cases where there are additional characters after the short option.
