Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the 'toMap' method of the CSVRecord class when there is no header in the CSV file. The purpose is to ensure that the resulting map is empty.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this source code is to fix the 'toMap' method in the CSVRecord class so that it correctly handles the case when there is no header in the CSV file. Currently, it is not returning an empty map as expected.
