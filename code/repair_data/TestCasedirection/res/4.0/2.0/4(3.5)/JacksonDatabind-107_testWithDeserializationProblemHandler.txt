Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the code when using a DeserializationProblemHandler to handle unknown type ids during deserialization.

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to properly handle unknown type ids by calling the DeserializationProblemHandler's handleUnknownTypeId() method.
