Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the `isCachable()` method when a custom map value deserializer is used.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code is to update the `isCachable()` method to consider the existence of a custom map value deserializer in addition to the existing conditions.
