Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the correctness of the Base64 encoding functionality provided by the `encodeBase64String` method.

Repair strategy: The `encodeBase64String` method is failing to produce the expected encoded strings for the given input. To fix this, the source code needs to be modified to correctly encode the input data into Base64 format.
