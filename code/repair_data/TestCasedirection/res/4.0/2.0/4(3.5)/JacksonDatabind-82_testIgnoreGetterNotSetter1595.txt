Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the getter method for the "name" property of the "Simple1595" class ignores the JSON value during deserialization.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case would involve modifying the code to properly ignore the "name" property during deserialization. This can be done by adding the "@JsonIgnore" annotation to the getter method for the "name" property in the "Simple1595" class.
