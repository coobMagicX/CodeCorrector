Intent: The purpose of the failing test case is to check if the `foo` method in class `G` correctly overrides the `foo` method in superclass `F`. 

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this code is to ensure that the `foo` method in class `G` has the same parameter types as the `foo` method in superclass `F`.
