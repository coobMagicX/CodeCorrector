Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the functionality of compressing eight empty files.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of compressing empty files. Currently, the code does not handle this case correctly, resulting in a failing test case. The repair direction is to add a condition to check for empty files and handle them appropriately, ensuring that the compression is successful.
