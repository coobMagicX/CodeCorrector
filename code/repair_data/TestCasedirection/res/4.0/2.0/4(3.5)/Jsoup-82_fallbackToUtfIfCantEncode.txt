Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to ensure that when the input HTML document specifies a charset that cannot be encoded, the code falls back to using UTF-8 as the charset and correctly parses the document.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this code is to update the logic in the `parseInputStream` method to properly handle cases where the specified charset cannot be encoded. This may involve adding additional checks and fallback mechanisms to ensure that UTF-8 is used as the charset in such cases.
