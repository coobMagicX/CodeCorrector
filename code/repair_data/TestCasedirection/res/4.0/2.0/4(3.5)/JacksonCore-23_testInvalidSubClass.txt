Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that an IllegalStateException is thrown when creating an instance of a subclass that does not override the createInstance() method.

Repair strategy: The source code should be modified to throw an IllegalStateException when the createInstance() method is called on a subclass that does not override it.
