Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that trying to create an ArchiveInputStream for a non-archive file should throw an ArchiveException with a specific error message.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve modifying the source code to properly handle the case of trying to create an ArchiveInputStream for a non-archive file. This can be done by adding a check to detect if the input stream does not match any of the supported archive formats, and throw an ArchiveException with the appropriate error message in that case.
