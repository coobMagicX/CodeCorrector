Intent: The purpose of the failing test cases is to test the functionality of the readBits() method when reading bits in big endian byte order and encountering an overflow.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve fixing the overflow issue when shifting the bitsCachedSize left by 8 bits in the while loop. The overflow issue can be fixed by checking if bitsCachedSize is greater than or equal to 57 before performing the shift operation. If it is, the shift operation should be skipped.
