Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to confirm that the "stopAtNonOption" parameter is working correctly. It is expected that the "cl.getArgList()" method should return a list of 3 extra arguments.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the logic related to processing command line tokens. Specifically, the issue might be with the handling of tokens that start with "--" or tokens that start with "-" but have a length greater than 2. The fix should ensure that the correct tokens are added to the "tokens" list and that the "cl.getArgList()" method returns the expected number of extra arguments.
