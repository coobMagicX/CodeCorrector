Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the option value is correctly parsed when it is specified with a short option and an equal sign.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this failed test case is to modify the source code to correctly handle short options with equal signs. Currently, the code only checks if the short option exists in the options object, but it does not handle the case where the short option is followed by an equal sign and a value. The repair direction is to add a condition that checks for the presence of an equal sign after a short option and correctly parses the value.
