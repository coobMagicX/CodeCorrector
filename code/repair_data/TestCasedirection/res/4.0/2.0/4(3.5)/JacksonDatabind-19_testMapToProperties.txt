Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the conversion of a Java object to a Properties object using the Jackson library. The test case checks if non-String values are correctly coerced to Strings.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to correctly convert non-String values to Strings when mapping a Java object to a Properties object.
