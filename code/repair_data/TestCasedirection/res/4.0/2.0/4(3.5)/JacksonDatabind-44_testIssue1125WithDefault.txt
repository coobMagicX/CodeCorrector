Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the deserialization of a JSON object into a Java object of type `Issue1125Wrapper` is successful and that the values of the deserialized object are correct.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to fix the deserialization process so that the values of the deserialized object match the expected values.
