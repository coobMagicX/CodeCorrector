Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify the correct handling of XML attributes with the `nextTextValue()` method in the source code.

Repair strategy: 
The repair strategy should focus on fixing the `nextTextValue()` method to correctly handle XML attributes. The method should be modified to handle the case where the current token is an attribute value and return the corresponding value. Additionally, the method should handle the case where the current token is the end of an element and return an empty string.
