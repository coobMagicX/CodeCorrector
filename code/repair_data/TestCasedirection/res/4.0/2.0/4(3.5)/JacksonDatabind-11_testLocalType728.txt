Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify the behavior of the "_fromVariable" method when constructing JavaType objects from method return types and parameter types.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this code should focus on correctly constructing JavaType objects from method return types and parameter types. The "_fromVariable" method needs to be modified to ensure that the constructed JavaType objects match the expected types.
