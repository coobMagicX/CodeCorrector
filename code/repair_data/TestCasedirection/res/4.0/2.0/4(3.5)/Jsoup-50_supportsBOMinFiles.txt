Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify that the code correctly parses HTML files with different byte order marks (BOM) and extracts the title and text content.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on ensuring that the code correctly detects and handles different BOMs in the input HTML files. The code should correctly decode the byte data and set the appropriate charset for parsing. Additionally, the code should correctly extract the title and text content from the parsed document.
