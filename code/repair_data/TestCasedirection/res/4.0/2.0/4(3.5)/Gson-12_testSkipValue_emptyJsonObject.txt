Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the behavior of the `skipValue` method when called on an empty JSON object.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to handle the case when the `peek()` method returns `JsonToken.NAME` in the `skipValue` method. Currently, it is only handling the else case where the `peek()` method does not return `JsonToken.NAME`.
