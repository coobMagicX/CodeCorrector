Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the encoding and decoding of an empty byte array using the "testByteByByte" method. 

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the encoding and decoding logic to handle empty byte arrays correctly. The fix should ensure that the encoding and decoding methods handle the empty byte array case properly without causing any errors.
