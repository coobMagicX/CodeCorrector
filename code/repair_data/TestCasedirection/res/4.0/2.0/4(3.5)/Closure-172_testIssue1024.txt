Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to check the behavior of the "isQualifiedNameInferred" method when dealing with assignments to the "prototype" property of objects.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for passing the test cases is to modify the "isQualifiedNameInferred" method to correctly handle assignments to the "prototype" property. The method should return false when the "qName" ends with ".prototype" and the "rhsValue" is not a function.
