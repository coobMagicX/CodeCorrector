Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that an exception is thrown when there is an issue with refining the serialization type.

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to handle the scenario where the serialization content type cannot be refined into the specified type. This could involve adding additional checks or error handling to ensure that the types are related before attempting to refine the content type.
