Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify the functionality of the BinaryEncoder by comparing the encoded binary data with the expected Base64 data.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to ensure that the BinaryEncoder correctly encodes the binary data into Base64 format.
