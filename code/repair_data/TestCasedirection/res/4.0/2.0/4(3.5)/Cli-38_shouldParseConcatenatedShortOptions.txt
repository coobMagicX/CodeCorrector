Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the command line parser correctly parses and recognizes concatenated short options.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue that causes the `getOptionValue("t1")` to return null. It seems that the code is not correctly handling the case where an option does not have a value assigned to it. The repair should ensure that the `getOptionValue` method returns an empty string instead of null when a value is not provided for an option.
