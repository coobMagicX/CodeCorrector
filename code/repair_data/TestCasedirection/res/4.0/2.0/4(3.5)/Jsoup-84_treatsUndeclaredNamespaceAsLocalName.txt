Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify the behavior when an undeclared namespace is treated as a local name.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy would involve updating the `head` method to handle undeclared namespaces correctly and ensure that they are treated as local names. This can be done by modifying the `updateNamespaces` method to handle undeclared namespaces and return an appropriate value for the `prefix`. Additionally, the code should be updated to set the `namespace` value to the default namespace if it is not found in the `namespacesStack`.
