Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the behavior of the `getNextEntry()` method when called on an empty Tar archive.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case can be to update the `getNextTarEntry()` method to handle the case when there are no more entries in the Tar archive. Currently, it returns `null` when `hasHitEOF` is true, but in this case, it should throw an `IOException` with an `IllegalArgumentException` as the cause.
