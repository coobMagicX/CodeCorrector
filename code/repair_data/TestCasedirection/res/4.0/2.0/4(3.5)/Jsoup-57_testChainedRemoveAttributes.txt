Intent: The intent and purpose of the failed test case is to verify that the "removeIgnoreCase" method correctly removes attributes from an element.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code should focus on fixing the issue with removing attributes from the element in a chained manner. Currently, the code does not support chaining multiple attribute removals, which is causing the test case to fail. The repair direction would be to modify the "removeIgnoreCase" method to handle chained attribute removals correctly.
