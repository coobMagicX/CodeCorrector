Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test the ability of the code to write a non-ASCII directory name in POSIX mode using TarArchiveOutputStream.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for this test case is to ensure that the code correctly handles non-ASCII characters in directory names. This may involve checking for non-ASCII characters and properly encoding them before writing to the archive.
