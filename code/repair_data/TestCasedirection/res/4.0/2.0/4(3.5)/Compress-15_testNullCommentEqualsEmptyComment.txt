Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify the behavior of the `equals` method in the `ZipArchiveEntry` class when comparing entries with null and empty comments.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for the source code is to handle the comparison of null and empty comments correctly in the `equals` method. Currently, the code treats null and non-null comments differently, which is causing the test cases to fail. The repair direction would be to modify the code to handle null and empty comments in a consistent way during the comparison.
