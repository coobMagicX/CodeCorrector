Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to test if the code can correctly handle the situation where the text to be wrapped is too long for a single line.

Repair strategy: The code seems to have a bug where it enters an infinite loop when the text to be wrapped is too long for a single line. The repair strategy should involve fixing the logic that determines the wrap position to ensure that it does not result in an infinite loop. This could include checking if the wrap position remains the same after trimming the text and handling the situation differently if the wrap position does not change.
