Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that an exception is thrown when trying to deserialize a nested type that is not a subtype of the expected type.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this issue is to update the code to properly handle the case where the nested type is not a subtype of the expected type. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the nested type is a subtype before attempting to deserialize it.
