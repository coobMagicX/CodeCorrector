Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `checkRequiredOptions()` method when there are required options that have not been processed. It expects that a `MissingOptionException` will be thrown with the correct error message.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the error in the `checkRequiredOptions()` method that causes the test case to fail. The error is likely related to the construction of the error message in the `buff` string buffer. The fix should ensure that the error message includes the names of the missing required options.
