Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to test the behavior of the `equals` method in the `StringUtils` class when comparing different types of `CharSequence` objects.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on handling the case when one `CharSequence` object is an instance of `StringBuilder` and the other is an instance of `String`. The `equals` method should be modified to handle this comparison correctly.
