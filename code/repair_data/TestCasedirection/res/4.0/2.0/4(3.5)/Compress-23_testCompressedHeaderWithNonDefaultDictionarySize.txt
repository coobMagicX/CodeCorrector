Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that a SevenZFile object can be created and read successfully from a compressed file with a non-default dictionary size.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to support reading from a compressed file with a non-default dictionary size. This can be done by ensuring that the dictionary size is properly passed to the LZMAInputStream constructor when creating a new SevenZFile object.
