Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to test the behavior of reading JSON objects and arrays using the ObjectMapper with default typing enabled.

Repair strategy: The repair direction for the source code is to ensure that the ObjectMapper correctly handles reading JSON arrays with default typing enabled. The issue may lie in the logic that determines whether the type applies to JSON tree models. This logic should be reviewed and updated if necessary to correctly handle arrays with default typing.
