Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the `getBinaryValue()` method can correctly decode a Base64 encoded text node and return the corresponding binary value.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue that causes the `getBinaryValue()` method to fail. This could involve debugging and identifying any exceptions or errors that are thrown during the decoding process. Additionally, verifying the implementation of the `binaryValue()` method and checking for any potential issues related to coercion from `TextNode` to `byte[]` may be necessary.
