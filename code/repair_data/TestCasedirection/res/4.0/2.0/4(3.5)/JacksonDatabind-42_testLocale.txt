Intent: The intent of the failed test cases is to verify that the deserialization of an empty string into a `Locale` object returns `Locale.ROOT`.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve updating the `_deserializeFromEmptyString()` method in the source code to correctly handle the deserialization of an empty string into a `Locale` object.
