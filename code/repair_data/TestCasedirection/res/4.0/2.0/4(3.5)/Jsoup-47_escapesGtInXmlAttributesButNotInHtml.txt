Intent: The intent and purpose of the failed test case is to verify that the ">" character is escaped in XML attributes but not in HTML.

Repair strategy: The code needs to be modified to properly escape the ">" character when in XML attributes, but not in HTML. One possible repair direction is to add a condition to check if the character is ">" and if it is in an XML attribute. If it meets these conditions, it should be escaped as "&gt;".
