Intent: The intent of the test case is to verify that the `getLineNumber()` method correctly returns the line number of the CSVParser.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should focus on fixing the issue with `getLineNumber()` returning an incorrect line number. One possible direction for repair is to update the implementation of the `read()` method to handle carriage return characters (`\r`) properly and increment the `lineCounter` accordingly.
