Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to test the deserialization of a polymorphic type using a custom deserializer.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve checking the deserialization logic in the `_findDeserializer` method to ensure that it correctly handles the deserialization of the polymorphic type. Additionally, the custom deserializer for the polymorphic type should be implemented or updated to handle the deserialization correctly.
