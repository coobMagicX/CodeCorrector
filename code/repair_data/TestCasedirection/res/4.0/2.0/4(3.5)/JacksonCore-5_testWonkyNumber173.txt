Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the JsonPointer correctly identifies that it does not match the given path.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy should involve handling the case where the JsonPointer contains a number in scientific notation. Currently, the code treats the scientific notation as a regular number and tries to parse it. To fix this, the code should be modified to handle scientific notation separately and return -1 if it encounters it.
