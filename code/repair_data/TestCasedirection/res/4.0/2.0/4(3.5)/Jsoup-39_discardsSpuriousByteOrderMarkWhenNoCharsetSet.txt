Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that the code correctly parses HTML data and discards any spurious byte order mark (BOM) when no charset is set. 

Repair strategy: The code should be modified to correctly handle the presence of a BOM at the beginning of the document data. The BOM should be removed, and the charset should be set to the default charset.
