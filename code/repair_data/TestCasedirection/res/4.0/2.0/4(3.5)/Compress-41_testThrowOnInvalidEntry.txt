Intent: The intent of the failed test case is to verify that an IOException is thrown when trying to read an invalid entry from a zip archive.

Repair strategy: The repair strategy for this test case is to handle the IOException correctly when an invalid entry is encountered in the zip archive. The code should throw a ZipException with the appropriate error message containing the "Unexpected record signature" when such an entry is encountered.
