Intent: The intent of the test case `testQuotedProps` is to verify if the method `isJSIdentifier` correctly identifies valid JavaScript object property names, including those with special characters, spaces, or other non-traditional identifier characters that are nonetheless permissible within quoted property names in JavaScript.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isJSIdentifier` method to support validation of JavaScript property names that can include characters not typically allowed in unquoted JavaScript identifiers but are valid in quoted identifiers. This may involve adjusting the logic to handle edge cases like empty strings, numbers, special characters, and Unicode characters within quoted properties, or potentially using a different set of character validation rules that align more closely with JavaScript's property naming conventions. Consider using a parsing or validation approach that directly reflects JavaScript's own rules for identifiers within object literals, possibly by integrating or mimicking a JavaScript parsing library's behavior or implementing a regex pattern that matches JavaScript's identifier rules for properties.
