Intent: The test case `testBug1864222` aims to verify that the method `createCopy` can correctly handle and create a subseries between two dates where the start date does not directly match any date in the series but falls between existing data points, and the end date also doesn't match but falls between data points.

Repair strategy: The issue likely lies in how the method calculates `startIndex` and `endIndex` when the dates do not directly exist in the data series. Specifically, the method should ensure that even if `start` and `end` are not present as exact entries, it should adjust to include the nearest previous data point for `start` and the nearest next data point after `end` but before this point, it should not include the next point if it exceeds `end`. Check the calculations and conditions around adjusting `startIndex` and `endIndex` when negative values are returned from `getIndex()`. Consider revising the logic to better handle edge cases where `start` and `end` dates are between the existing data points.
