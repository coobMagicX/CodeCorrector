Intent: The intent of the test case `testParseLicenseAscii` is to verify that the method correctly parses and extracts the license text from a multiline comment block, preserving the format and spacing as provided in the comment, and then correctly assigns this extracted text to the JsDocInfo of a node.

Repair strategy: Review and possibly revise the handling of whitespace and newline characters (`\n`) in the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method. Ensure that the method correctly preserves the formatting and spacing when the `WhitespaceOption.SINGLE_LINE` is not used. This may involve adjusting how whitespace and newlines are appended to the `StringBuilder` and ensuring that the `trimEnd` function (if it exists and is used) properly handles spaces at the end of lines without removing necessary formatting. Additionally, confirm that the state transitions and token parsing logic, especially for `EOL` and `ANNOTATION` tokens, do not inadvertently alter the expected format of output text.
