Intent: The test case `testLang538` is intended to validate that the `FastDateFormat` formats a `GregorianCalendar` object, which is set with a specific date and time in a non-default time zone (GMT-8), to a string representation in GMT. The intent is to ensure that the date and time conversion respects the time zone settings and accurately converts the local time to the specified GMT format.

Repair strategy: The problem may arise from the `FastDateFormat.format` method not properly handling the time zone conversion when formatting the date. The source code provided suggests altering the timezone of the calendar object when `mTimeZoneForced` is true, but the test case suggests issues when the formatted date does not match the expected GMT representation. To fix this:

1. Verify and ensure that the `FastDateFormat.getInstance` method and its subsequent date formatting properly account for the time zone passed during its instantiation (in this case, GMT).
2. Check if there is a need to adjust the implementation of how the timezone information is applied in the `format` method to ensure that the output string correctly reflects the intended GMT time, rather than just converting the time fields without adjusting for the timezone difference.
3. Review the `applyRules` method (invoked within the `format` method of the provided source code) to ensure it correctly applies formatting rules that include timezone adjustments, as the formatting discrepancy might be occurring there.
4. Additionally, ensure the `Calendar` object's timezone is correctly set and used throughout the formatting process in the `FastDateFormat` class, as discrepancies in timezone handling could lead to incorrect formatting outputs as observed in the failed test case.
