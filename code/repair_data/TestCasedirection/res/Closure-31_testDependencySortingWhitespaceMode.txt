Intent: The intent of the test case `testDependencySortingWhitespaceMode` is to verify that the source code properly handles dependency management and sorting when the compilation level is set to "WHITESPACE_ONLY". It checks if the system correctly orders the scripts based on their `goog.provide` and `goog.require` relationships, ensuring that dependencies are resolved correctly in a minimal modification compilation mode.

Repair strategy: Investigate and correct the dependency management logic in the source code to ensure that input scripts are reordered correctly based on their dependencies. Particularly focus on the implementation within the `manageDependencies` method of the `moduleGraph` and ensure it handles the "WHITESPACE_ONLY" compilation level appropriately. Additionally, verify that the flags related to dependency management (`options.dependencyOptions.needsManagement()` and `options.manageClosureDependencies`) are correctly interpreted and applied during the sorting process.
