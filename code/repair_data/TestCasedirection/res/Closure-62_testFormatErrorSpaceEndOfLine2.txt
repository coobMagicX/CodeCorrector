Intent: The purpose of the test case `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine2` is to verify that the `format` function correctly formats an error message with a pointer (`^`) under the character position of an error in a JavaScript source excerpt. The error occurs at the end of the line just before a space character.

Repair strategy: The test case suggests a potential issue in the handling of character positions and whitespace when formatting the error pointer. The source code should be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that:
1. The `charno` (character position of the error) is correctly calculated and used to place the error pointer (`^`).
2. Any discrepancies in how whitespace and end-of-line characters are treated in the source excerpt should be addressed.
3. Ensure that the loop and conditions that generate the spaces before the `^` character handle all edge cases, including when the error occurs at or near the end of the line.
