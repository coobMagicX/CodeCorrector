Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testThisTypeOfFunction2` is to verify that functions explicitly annotated with a specific 'this' type (using JSDoc `@type {function(this:F)}`) must be invoked in a context that respects this 'this' type annotation. Specifically, it checks whether the function is called on an instance of the type `F` or through a property access (e.g., `obj.f()` where `obj` is of type `F`).

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a check for functions with explicit 'this' types, ensuring they are called in a context that matches the specified 'this' type. This can be done by analyzing the context of the function call within the `visitCall` method to determine if the function is called as a method of an appropriate instance or through a valid property access. If the context does not meet the criteria, the code should report an appropriate type-checking error. The repair should enhance the condition logic around how function calls are validated, particularly focusing on the handling of `this` type requirements in function calls.
