Intent: The test case `testLang300` seems designed to verify the handling of numeric strings ending with 'l' or 'L', which should indicate that the number is of type `long`. The test aims to ensure the method can correctly interpret and convert strings representing long integers with a trailing 'l' or 'L' into `Long` objects.

Repair strategy:
1. Verify the logic inside the `createNumber` method that handles strings ending with 'l' or 'L'. Ensure it correctly parses the numeric part of the string, ignoring the trailing character, and attempts to create a `Long` object.
2. Correct the conditional checks and parsing logic to handle cases where the string starts with "0" (like in "01l") or does not start with any digits other than '0' (like in "1l").
3. Confirm that the method `createLong` is being called for strings ending with 'l' or 'L' and that this method can handle leading zeros or any valid long integer representation correctly.
4. Ensure that exceptions or errors in number format are handled gracefully and that an appropriate exception is thrown if the number cannot be parsed to a long due to its size or format issues.
