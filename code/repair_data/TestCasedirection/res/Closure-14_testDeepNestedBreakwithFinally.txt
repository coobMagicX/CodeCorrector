Intent: The intent of the test `testDeepNestedBreakwithFinally` is to verify the correct control flow for a code snippet involving nested loops and try-finally blocks, particularly ensuring that the control flow transitions correctly from a `break` statement to a `finally` block, and from one `finally` block to another `finally` block in nested structures.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the handling of the control flow transitions when `break` statements are used within nested loops and try-finally blocks. Specifically, the source code should be adjusted to correctly identify and handle the transition from the inner `finally` block to the outer `finally` block, ensuring that control flow is transferred appropriately. This might involve refining the logic in the `Token.TRY` case in the switch statement or modifying how `finally` blocks are processed in relation to `break` statements and loop constructs within the `computeFollowNode` method. The logic that determines the next node to transfer control to after exiting a `finally` block should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly restructured to accommodate complex nested structures more accurately.
