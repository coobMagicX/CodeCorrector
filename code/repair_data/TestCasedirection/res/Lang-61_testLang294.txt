Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLang294` is to verify the functionality of the `deleteAll` method in the `StrBuilder` class. This method is supposed to remove all occurrences of a specified substring (`"\n%BLAH%"`) from the `StrBuilder` object's internal buffer.

Repair strategy: Given the failure of the test case, the likely issue lies in the implementation of the `deleteAll` method, which internally might use the `indexOf` method to find occurrences of the substring to delete. The potential errors in the `indexOf` method can be incorrect calculation of the length (`len`) up to which the search is performed or improper handling of cases when substring matches are at the boundaries of the buffer.

1. Review and adjust the calculation of `len` in the `indexOf` method to ensure that the search covers potential matches that occur at the end of the buffer.
2. Ensure that the loop termination condition in `indexOf` correctly accounts for the last possible starting position of a substring search within the buffer, which should be `size - strLen`.
3. Investigate the boundaries and edge cases in the `indexOf` method, especially scenarios where substrings start or end at the edges of the `buffer`.
4. Verify and possibly refactor the loop and conditions inside the `indexOf` method to ensure that all characters of the substring are correctly compared against the characters in the buffer, particularly when substrings occur at or near the end of the buffer.
