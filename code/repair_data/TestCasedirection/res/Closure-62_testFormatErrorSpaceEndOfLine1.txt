Intent: The intent of the test case `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1` is to validate that the `format` method correctly formats an error message, including the filename, line number, error level (ERROR), error description, the source excerpt, and specifically, an arrow (^) pointing to the character position where the error occurred in the source code.

Repair strategy: The potential errors in the source code could be related to incorrect handling of character positions in the source excerpt or mishandling of how the arrow marking the error position is added. Ensure that:
1. The `charno` (character position) is correctly passed and used in the method to determine where the arrow should be placed.
2. The condition checks for placing the arrow are accurate, ensuring it correctly calculates spaces for all types of characters (not just whitespace) and correctly appends the arrow even when `charno` is at the end of the line.
3. The loop that appends spaces before the arrow correctly handles all characters and maintains proper alignment with the source excerpt.
4. Review and correct the logic used to append the `sourceExcerpt` and the arrow marking, ensuring that the arrow points precisely to the reported character position indicated by `charno`, especially when this position is at or near the end of the line.
