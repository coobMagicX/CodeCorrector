Intent: The test case `testSyntaxError1` is intended to verify that the method `extractMessage` correctly identifies and reports a JavaScript syntax error within the provided code snippet. It expects the method to throw a `RuntimeException` with a specific error message that includes details about the syntax error and the erroneous line of code.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the `extractMessage` method or related functionality correctly parses the input JavaScript code to detect syntax errors and formats the error message appropriately to include the line of code causing the error. This might involve enhancing the error detection and message formatting logic within the method or its dependencies to accurately capture and report syntax errors with the corresponding line from the input code.
