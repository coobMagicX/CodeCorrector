Intent: The purpose of the test case `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is to verify if the function `containsAny` can accurately check the presence of Unicode supplementary characters (characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP) within a given CharSequence. The function should return true if any character from the `searchChars` array is found in the `CharSequence` and handle characters that are represented by surrogate pairs in Java.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `containsAny` does not correctly handle supplementary characters, which are represented by a pair of `char` values (surrogate pairs) in Java. The function incorrectly tries to match these surrogate pairs with individual characters in the `searchChars` array. The repair should involve modifying the implementation to correctly recognize and match surrogate pairs in both the `CharSequence` and the `searchChars` array. This might involve checking pairs of characters in the `CharSequence` against pairs in `searchChars` or converting both to a format (like `String` or `int` code points) that inherently supports supplementary characters before comparison.
