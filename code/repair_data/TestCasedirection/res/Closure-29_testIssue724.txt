Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue724` is to verify that the code optimizer correctly handles and optimizes JavaScript functions, particularly in scenarios where a function checks if a given variable is a function using the `toString` method applied to a local object. The expected outcome is that the function is reduced and optimized without altering its logical operation.

Repair strategy: Analyze how the code optimization process handles methods such as `toString` being called on objects within a function. Ensure that local object properties are not erroneously optimized away or renamed in a manner that changes the functionality of the method `toString.apply`. The repair should focus on preserving the context and scope of object methods and properties during the optimization process to maintain the functionality integrity of the JavaScript being optimized.
