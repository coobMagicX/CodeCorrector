Intent: The intent of the test case `testTemplatized11` is to verify that the type inference system correctly handles multiple type templates (T and K) in a JavaScript function, where the method in a templated class can take a parameter that could be of two possible templated types and returns one of the templated types.

Repair strategy: The source code should be checked and possibly modified to ensure that it can handle multiple template types correctly, specifically where functions or methods involve more than one type parameter. The type inference mechanism must accurately map each template type in the function signature to the corresponding actual type used in the function call. If the type inference system fails to handle multiple or nested templates properly, it should be enhanced to track and resolve each template type based on the context of the function call and the function definition. This would likely involve refining the logic in `inferTemplateTypesFromParameters` to better handle complex template scenarios and ensuring that `TemplateTypeReplacer` can correctly apply inferred types, especially when dealing with multiple or nested type templates. Finally, validate that the `setJSType` applies the correct function and return types to the corresponding nodes in the AST.
