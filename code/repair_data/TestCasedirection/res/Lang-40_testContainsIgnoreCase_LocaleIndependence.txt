Intent: The intent of the test case `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` is to ensure that the `containsIgnoreCase` method can correctly identify whether one string contains another string, irrespective of case and locale variations. This includes handling special characters and locale-specific case mappings correctly.

Repair strategy: The current implementation of `containsIgnoreCase` uses `toUpperCase()` method which can lead to incorrect results for certain characters in locale-sensitive languages (e.g., Turkish where the uppercase version of 'i' is not 'I'). To fix this, modify the `containsIgnoreCase` method to use `toLowerCase()` instead of `toUpperCase()` for both the input string and the search string. Additionally, ensure that the `toLowerCase()` method is invoked with a locale argument (preferably `Locale.ROOT`) to avoid locale-specific transformations that might not apply universally. This will help ensure that the function behaves consistently across different locales.
