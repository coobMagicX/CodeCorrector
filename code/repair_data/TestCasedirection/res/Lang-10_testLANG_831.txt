Intent:
The intent of the `escapeRegex` method is to transform a given string `value` into a regex pattern string that can be used for matching text. This involves escaping special regex characters and handling sequences of whitespace characters. When the `unquote` parameter is true, the method should unquote any escaped single quotes in the input.

Repair strategy:
1. **Handling Increment Inside Conditions**: The source code increments index `i` inside a condition when handling the unquoting of single quotes. This can lead to skipping the evaluation or incorrect handling of the character following the quote, especially when it's the last character or a special character. Ensure that incrementing the index `i` doesn't skip necessary processing or checks, perhaps by reorganizing how characters are read and processed within the loop.
2. **Whitespace Handling**: The method attempts to collapse multiple whitespace characters into a regex pattern that matches multiple whitespaces. There might be an issue if the input string ends on whitespace, or if whitespace handling interferes with subsequent characters. Ensure that the transition from whitespace to non-whitespace characters is handled correctly, preserving the intended logic of collapsing whitespace.
3. **Special Characters Escaping**: Ensure all special regex characters are correctly escaped, and that appending these characters to the `regex` StringBuilder is done in a manner that doesn't interfere with other logic, particularly with the unquoting mechanism.
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Check boundary conditions such as the start and end of the string, and the transitions between different types of characters (like from a special character to a whitespace), to ensure that the regex pattern is built correctly without missing or misinterpreting characters.
