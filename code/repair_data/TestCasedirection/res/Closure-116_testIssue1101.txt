Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue1101` is to verify if the function can correctly inline a function call where the function captures a variable from its enclosing scope, and then uses this captured variable together with a function call that also involves the object from which the variable was captured. This is to ensure that side-effects related to object properties and multiple evaluations involving the same object are handled correctly during inlining.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be updated to handle cases where arguments passed to a function can be expressions that involve property accesses, which may have side effects or rely on mutable state. The repair should ensure that the inlining logic properly accounts for the usage of object properties and correctly tracks references and states to prevent incorrect inlining when the function parameters or the argument expressions can influence each other's outcome due to mutable state or side effects. This may involve enhancing the checks in `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` and possibly adjusting the evaluation order or preservation of original argument states in the inlining process.
