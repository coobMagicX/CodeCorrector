Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testNonAliasLocal()` is to ensure that the method `findAliases` properly identifies and reports non-alias local variables and functions within the scope that do not conform to expected aliasing patterns. This includes simple assignments, compound assignments with operations, array-style access, multiple declarations in one statement, and function declarations.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to correctly handle and report different types of variable declarations and function definitions that do not meet the criteria for aliases. Specifically:
1. Ensure that function declarations are recognized and reported as non-aliases since functions like `function f() {}` are not being handled as per the failed test indicating the need for better parsing and identification of function nodes in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
2. Improve the condition checks in the source code to detect and handle different styles of variable assignments that do not create aliases (e.g., direct values, operations, and array accesses).
3. Ensure that the logic parses and evaluates each variable declaration within a statement separately, even when multiple variables are declared in a single statement.
4. Expand the alias detection logic to accurately differentiate between aliasing and non-aliasing patterns, potentially by refining the conditions under which the `GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL` is reported.
