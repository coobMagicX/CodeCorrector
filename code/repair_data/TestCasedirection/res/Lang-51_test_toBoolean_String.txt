Intent: The intent of the failed test case `assertEquals(false, BooleanUtils.toBoolean("tru"));` is to verify that the `toBoolean` method correctly returns `false` for a string that is not a valid representation of `true` but is close, such as "tru", which is missing the last character.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to handle cases where strings are similar to "true" but are not exactly "true", "TRUE", or any case-insensitive variation of "true" that matches the entirety of the word. This should prompt a return of `false`. The main direction here is to ensure that the string length specifically matches the expected lengths for "true", "on", "yes" and their variations before deciding the boolean value, and any deviation in length should directly lead to a `false` return, avoiding false positives.
