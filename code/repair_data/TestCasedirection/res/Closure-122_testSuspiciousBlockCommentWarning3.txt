Intent: The intent of the test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning3` is to verify that the method `handleBlockComment` correctly identifies and reports a warning for block comments that contain suspicious patterns which may resemble annotations but start incorrectly with a newline and a space before the `@` symbol.

Repair strategy: Modify the condition in the `handleBlockComment` method to correctly detect and handle cases where the suspicious pattern starts on a new line following a space. Specifically, adjust the string patterns being checked in the `indexOf` method to include cases where there is a newline character followed directly by a space and then `*@`. This might involve refining the condition to account for different whitespace characters or variations in the placement of `@`. Adjusting the method to use regular expressions for more flexible and robust pattern matching could also be considered.
