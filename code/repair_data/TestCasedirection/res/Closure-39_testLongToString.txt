Intent: The test `testLongToString` is designed to verify that the `toStringHelper` method correctly formats the string representation of a `JSType` object. The test checks two scenarios: one with the `prettyPrint` option resulting in a truncated output after a maximum property count, and another without truncation displaying all properties.

Repair strategy:
1. Verify and adjust the `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` constant to ensure it matches the expected number of properties before truncation occurs.
2. Review and fix the mechanism that toggles the `prettyPrint` variable or alternatively, refactor the method to handle the `prettyPrint` state more reliably, ensuring that it correctly influences the output based on the method being called (`toString` vs `toAnnotationString`).
3. Ensure that the properties are correctly added and retrieved, maintaining their order, particularly when `prettyPrint` is false, to ensure all properties are displayed as expected in `toAnnotationString`.
