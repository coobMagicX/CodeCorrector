Intent: The intent of the test case `testRemoveGlobal2` is to verify that the function `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` does not modify the argument list of a function when the flag `removeGlobal` is set to `false`. The function should remain unchanged if it is intended that global removal is not allowed, even if the function arguments are not referenced inside the function body.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a conditional check to see if `removeGlobal` is `false` and, if so, skip the argument removal process entirely from the function regardless of whether the arguments are referenced or not. This can be achieved by modifying the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` function to check the state of `removeGlobal` before proceeding with any modifications to the function's arguments.
