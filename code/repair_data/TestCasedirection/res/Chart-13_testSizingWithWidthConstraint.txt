Intent: The intent of the failing test cases is to verify that the `arrangeFF` method correctly computes and sets the dimensions of various layout blocks within a container, considering constraints on height and width. The method should allocate space to blocks positioned at the top, bottom, left, right, and center, ensuring they fit within the specified constraints and do not overlap incorrectly.

Repair strategy: It seems the layout computation might not be handling the accumulation of block heights and widths correctly, especially when multiple blocks are present and constraints are tight (e.g., fixed width with multiple blocks trying to fit horizontally or vertically). The repair should involve:
1. Reviewing and potentially revising the logic that calculates remaining height and width after each block is arranged to ensure that it accurately reflects the space actually available for subsequent blocks.
2. Ensuring that constraints passed to each block during their arrangement (especially in `RectangleConstraint` objects) correctly reflect the space left by other blocks.
3. Adding checks or recalculations after each block arrangement to adjust the available size for the next block, particularly ensuring that the size does not turn negative or exceed the total available space.
4. Verifying that the boundary setting logic (`setBounds` for each block) correctly interprets the size and position calculations to avoid any overlaps or misplacements.
