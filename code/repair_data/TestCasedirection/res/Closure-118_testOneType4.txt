Intent: The purpose of the test case `testOneType4` is to verify the behavior of handling object literals in a JavaScript context, particularly to check if properties on prototypes are handled correctly without erroneous type invalidation or mismanagement when the same property is accessed and set multiple times. The test involves defining a constructor function `Foo`, setting its prototype to an object with a numeric property, and then creating an instance of `Foo` and modifying the property within the instance.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that property type checks and management within object literals are correctly distinguishing between prototype properties and instance properties. This requires:
1. Checking whether the property belongs to the prototype or the instance, and handling these cases differently if necessary.
2. Ensuring that type-related decisions (such as type invalidation and renaming strategies) take into account whether the property access is modifying a prototype's property or an instance's own property.
3. Adjusting the error reporting mechanism to correctly reflect issues relevant to prototype properties versus instance properties, avoiding unnecessary or incorrect error reports for prototype property manipulations that are legal.
