Intent: The test case `testAtan2SpecialCases` is designed to verify the correct behavior of the `atan2` method when handling special edge cases involving zero and negative zero values for both `x` and `y` coordinates. This is crucial for ensuring the method complies with the mathematical definition of the atan2 function, which is sensitive to signs of zero, particularly in polar coordinate transformations and related computations.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be enhanced to correctly handle cases where both `x` and `y` are zero or negative zero. The current implementation might be incorrectly calculating or missing the special case handling entirely for these values. The repair should involve:

1. Adding explicit checks for the values of `x` and `y` being zero or negative zero at the beginning of the `atan2` method.
2. Ensuring the method returns the correct angle value (`0`, `π`, `-π`, `π/2`, `-π/2`) based on the combination of signs for `x` and `y`. This might include using `copySign` to preserve the sign of zero when necessary.
3. Ensuring that the rest of the method's logic does not interfere or override the computations for these special cases.
4. Adding or enhancing unit tests to cover all combinations of zero and negative zero inputs to prevent regressions in future changes.
