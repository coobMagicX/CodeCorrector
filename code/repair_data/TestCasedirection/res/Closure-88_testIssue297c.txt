Intent: The intent of the test case `testIssue297c` is to check whether the function correctly handles variable assignments and usage within a logical AND operation, ensuring proper read and kill states are maintained. The test seems to be validating if the variable `x` is marked correctly as READ or KILL across different operations within the same expression.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be adjusted to handle the scenario where the variable is assigned and then passed to a function within the same logical expression more accurately. This involves ensuring that the `isVariableReadBeforeKill` method correctly identifies and distinguishes between the variable being READ after being assigned a new value (`KILL`) within complex expressions like logical operations. The key repair would involve refining the logic to handle nested expressions and assignments better, possibly by enhancing the check conditions in the recursive traversal of child nodes to maintain accurate liveness states across such operations.
