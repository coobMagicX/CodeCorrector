Intent: The test case `testAnnotationInExterns_new4` is intended to verify that the method `externObjSEThisMethod('')` called on an instance of `externObjSEThis` created via the `new` keyword is recognized as side-effect free, or behaves in a manner consistent with the expectations set by annotations in externs.

Repair strategy: The source code needs to be modified to accurately handle cases where methods are called on objects instantiated with the `new` keyword, particularly in determining whether such method calls are side-effect free. The current implementation in the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function might be incorrectly evaluating the side-effect status of such method calls. Considering the provided source code lacks specific handling for method calls on new object instances, adding detailed logic to handle this scenario in the `Token.CALL` and `Token.NEW` cases will likely resolve the issue. The logic should properly assess whether a method call on a newly instantiated object can be considered local (i.e., side-effect free) based on annotations or other criteria specified for external objects. Additionally, the implementation should ensure that the `locals` predicate and other utility functions like `isImmutableValue` and `callHasLocalResult` are correctly used to evaluate the side-effect status.
