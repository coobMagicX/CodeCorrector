Intent: The intent of the test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning5` is to verify that the `handleBlockComment` method correctly identifies and reports a warning when a block comment contains suspicious annotations (like `@type`) that are not properly formatted or are potentially misplaced.

Repair strategy: The implementation of the `handleBlockComment` method should be adjusted to more accurately detect the presence of suspicious annotation patterns within block comments, irrespective of their exact position or whitespace variations. The current method only checks for two specific patterns and does not account for different variations in the whitespace or newlines before the annotation. A more robust pattern matching technique (possibly using regular expressions) should be employed to ensure that all variations of suspicious annotations are detected, allowing the test case to pass.
