Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testIssue821` is to verify the functionality of the `foldSame` method which likely processes and simplifies JavaScript expressions. The specific example checks if the method can handle and correctly process an expression involving a ternary operation that conditionally combines strings and numbers, followed by arithmetic operations.

Repair strategy: Given the nature of the failure in handling the ternary operation that outputs different types based on a condition, the error may reside in how different data types are handled or combined within the `foldSame` method or related functions. The key direction for repair should focus on enhancing the type handling and operation behavior in the `foldSame` method when dealing with mixed-type operations involving strings and numbers. Ensure that the method correctly identifies and processes expressions where data types might vary depending on runtime conditions, and that it preserves the expression semantics correctly when simplifying or folding the code.
