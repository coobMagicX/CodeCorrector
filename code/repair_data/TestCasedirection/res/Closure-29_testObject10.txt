Intent: The `isInlinableObject` method is designed to determine whether a set of references to object properties are suitable for inlining, based on several conditions such as whether properties are defined on the object, whether assignments are simple or involve self-referential or ES5 getter/setter definitions. The test cases aim to verify if object properties are correctly identified for inlining under various scenarios, including cases where additional properties are added after initial assignment, and where object properties are referenced in conditional expressions.

Repair strategy: The code needs modification to handle the inlining of object properties correctly when additional properties are added post-initial assignment and used in subsequent expressions. The method should also ensure that it can handle cases where object properties that are not initially defined in the object literal are referenced later in the code. This involves:
1. Adjusting the logic to track and handle changes to objects after their initial definition.
2. Ensuring that any added properties are also considered for inlining if they meet the conditions already outlined for the initially defined properties.
3. Modifying the method to accurately assess and handle the scope and usage of object properties, especially when they are used in expressions or conditions post their initial definition. This might involve a more dynamic tracking of object properties and their usage throughout the code block in which they are referenced.
