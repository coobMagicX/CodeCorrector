Intent: The test case `testImplementsExtendsLoop` is intended to verify if the system can accurately detect and report a cycle in the inheritance chain (loop between `implements` and `extends`), specifically when a constructor `F` extends a constructor `G` that implements `F`.

Repair strategy: Review and enhance the logic within the `resolveInternal` method to effectively detect and handle inheritance cycles. The current method might not be accurately identifying cycles between `implements` and `extends` relationships. Ensure the cycle detection (`detectImplicitPrototypeCycle`) is comprehensive and occurs before final type resolution and property continuation steps. Adjust the order of operations or improve the cycle detection logic to catch complex inheritance structures. Additionally, verify that the error handling (`handleTypeCycle`) appropriately responds to detected cycles, preventing further execution or resolution that assumes a correct inheritance structure.
