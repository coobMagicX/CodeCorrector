Intent: The intent of the test case `testXYAutoRange2` is to verify that the `NumberAxis` correctly computes its range to include all data points from the `XYSeries` in an `XYSeriesCollection` and adjusts the axis bounds accordingly. The test aims to confirm that the axis does not forcibly include zero in its range when `setAutoRangeIncludesZero(false)` is called, and that the axis bounds are slightly broader than the strict data bounds to accommodate all data points visually.

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that when setting the auto range for the axis, it correctly excludes zero if `setAutoRangeIncludesZero` is set to false. The calculation of the axis range bounds should also consider a margin around the data points to ensure all points are displayed without clipping. If the test is failing, it indicates possible issues in the `getDataRange` method or related axis range calculation methods not respecting the `setAutoRangeIncludesZero` setting or not calculating the bounds with an adequate margin. The repair should involve reviewing and potentially modifying the logic in `getDataRange` and any associated methods that contribute to calculating the axis bounds in relation to dataset bounds and axis settings.
