Intent: The intent of the test case `testDoubleInlining1` is to verify that the function `foo` can be inlined into `bar` and then `bar` can be inlined directly into the call site `foo(bar(x))`, resulting in the output `getWindow(x)`.

Repair strategy: The source code should correctly handle multiple levels of inlining where a function (like `bar`) that is itself inlined into another function (like `foo`) does not prevent the further inlining of `foo` into its call site. This requires checking and updating the inlining logic to ensure it can handle nested or sequential inlining operations without incorrectly blocking them due to internal state or side effects checks that do not reset or properly handle multiple inlining contexts. Additionally, ensure that the side effects and state mutation checks do not overly restrict valid inlining scenarios, especially when intermediate function bodies simply pass through their arguments without modification.
