Intent: The test case `testIssue297a` intends to verify that the method `isVariableReadBeforeKill` correctly identifies the liveness state (`READ`, `KILL`, or `MAYBE_LIVE`) of the variable `x` in a complex expression involving multiple assignments and logical operations. The purpose is to ensure that the variable's liveness accurately reflects its usage within the function, including cases where the variable is assigned multiple times and used in a logical expression.

Repair strategy: The repair should focus on enhancing the handling of complex expressions involving multiple assignments and logical operators. Specifically, the method should be able to differentiate and correctly update the state when a variable is reassigned and subsequently read within the same expression. This may involve refining the logic that determines when a variable is considered `KILL` versus `READ`, especially in nested or chained expressions. Additionally, improving the traversal and state update logic in the recursive analysis of child nodes could help in correctly propagating the liveness state across different parts of the expression.
