Intent: The test case `testLang315` intends to verify that the `StopWatch` class can correctly measure elapsed time, particularly ensuring that the time does not increase when the stopwatch is suspended. The test checks if the time recorded before and after the suspension remains the same, indicating that the stopwatch was effectively paused during the suspension.

Repair strategy: The source code should be revised to ensure that the `stop()` method does not alter the elapsed time when the stopwatch is in a suspended state. This may involve modifying the `stop()` method to check if the stopwatch was suspended and, if so, ensure that the elapsed time is correctly calculated by not including the duration of the suspension. This can be achieved by adjusting the `stopTime` to reflect only the active running time or by managing state transitions more carefully to account for suspensions.
