Intent: The purpose of the test case `testLANG805` is to verify that the `random` function can generate a string of specified length (3 characters in this case) using only the provided character array (`{'a'}`), irrespective of whether `letters` or `numbers` flags are true. It expects the function to return a string "aaa" when given these specific parameters.

Repair strategy: To address the failure, the source code should be modified to handle scenarios where both `letters` and `numbers` are false, and a specific set of characters is provided through the `chars` array. Specifically, the code should correctly calculate the range (`gap`) and use correct indexing when accessing elements from the `chars` array. The calculation of `gap` should consider the length of `chars` (not `end - start` when `chars` is not null) and index selection should be `chars[random.nextInt(chars.length)]` to avoid any `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or incorrect character selection. This will ensure that the function can build the string using only the characters provided in the `chars` array.
