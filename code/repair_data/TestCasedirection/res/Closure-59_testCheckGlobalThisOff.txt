Intent: The test case `testCheckGlobalThisOff` is intended to verify that the compiler does not issue warnings for global `this` usage when the `globalThis` diagnostic group is explicitly turned off.

Repair strategy: The source code should properly handle the deactivation of warnings for the `globalThis` diagnostic group when specified via compiler options. The implementation should ensure that such settings correctly influence the warnings emitted for global `this` usage. Review and adjust the logic within the `initOptions` method to ensure that the `globalThis` warning level is set correctly based on compiler options, particularly ensuring that the `PrintStreamErrorManager` or `ComposeWarningsGuard` respects these settings.
