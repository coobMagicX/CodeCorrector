Intent:
The intent of the `testTextExtents` test case is to verify the parsing of JSDoc comments correctly handles and interprets annotations, specifically ensuring that syntax errors, such as incorrect type annotations, are recognized and reported accurately.

Repair strategy:
Investigate and enhance the `parse` method or related components in the source code that handle the parsing and error detection within JSDoc comments. The strategy should include ensuring that the parser correctly identifies and handles syntax errors in type annotations within the JSDoc. Additionally, ensure the parser properly continues parsing even after new lines and spaces as indicated by `\n *    baz. */` in the test input. This might involve refining the logic that deals with line breaks and alignment in multiline comments.
