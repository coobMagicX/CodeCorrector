Intent: The intent of the test case `testGreatestSubtypeUnionTypes5` is to verify that the greatest subtype between a union of two error types (`EVAL_ERROR_TYPE` and `URI_ERROR_TYPE`) and a string object type (`STRING_OBJECT_TYPE`) results in `NO_OBJECT_TYPE`. This checks the behavior of handling type relations between error types and object types in the type system, ensuring correct type inference.

Repair strategy: The potential issue in the source code could be related to the handling of subtype relationships between union types and other specific types, particularly with the method `isSubtype` or how alternatives are added into `UnionTypeBuilder`. The repair should focus on:
1. Reviewing and possibly modifying the `isSubtype` method to ensure it correctly identifies when neither type in the type union (`EVAL_ERROR_TYPE` or `URI_ERROR_TYPE`) is a subtype of `STRING_OBJECT_TYPE`.
2. Ensuring that `JSType meet(JSType that)` correctly handles cases where no alternates are valid subtypes, and properly defaults to `NO_OBJECT_TYPE` or `NO_TYPE` when dealing with object types which do not intersect.
3. Consider adding more robust handling in the `else` block that deals with the return of `getNativeType(JSTypeNative.NO_OBJECT_TYPE)` or `getNativeType(JSTypeNative.NO_TYPE)` to cater for scenarios where the union type and the single type do not share a common subtype, ensuring that the default types are returned correctly.
