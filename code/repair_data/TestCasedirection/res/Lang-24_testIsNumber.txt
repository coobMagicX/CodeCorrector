Intent: The intent of the test case `assertFalse("isNumber(String) LANG-664 failed", NumberUtils.isNumber(val));` with `val = "1.1L";` is to verify that the method `isNumber(String)` correctly identifies strings that represent numbers with type qualifiers (in this case, 'L' for long) and rejects them when combined incorrectly, such as with a floating-point number. The test case is designed to ensure that the method adheres to number format rules where a long type qualifier ('L') should not follow a floating-point number.

Repair strategy: Modify the `isNumber(String)` method to ensure that it correctly handles cases where a type qualifier for long integers ('L' or 'l') follows a floating-point number. The method should return `false` if it encounters a decimal point (`.`) followed by a digit sequence and then an 'L' or 'l'. This involves adjusting the logic that checks the last character in the input string to verify that it does not illegitimately combine a decimal with a long integer type qualifier.
