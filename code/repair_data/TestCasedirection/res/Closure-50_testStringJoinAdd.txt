Intent: The intent of the function `tryFoldArrayJoin` is to optimize JavaScript code by folding array join operations into simpler string expressions when possible. The function checks if the operation involves immutable values or if collapsing the array elements into a string is shorter in size than the original expression. If conditions are met, it replaces the join call with a simpler string or a modified array join expression.

Repair strategy: Analyze the handling of mixed immutable and mutable values in the array. Ensure that strings are correctly concatenated around mutable values without losing the mutable reference, and adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where immutable values are adjacent to mutable ones. The code should properly account for scenarios where mutable objects (like `foo` in the test cases) are included in the array being joined. This involves:
1. Ensuring that when mutable and immutable types are mixed in an array, they are handled correctly without incorrectly merging mutable objects into strings.
2. Adjusting the building of the `arrayFoldedChildren` list to correctly represent sequences of immutable values separated by mutable values, ensuring that mutable values are correctly encapsulated as individual nodes in the resultant array.
