Intent: The test case `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` intends to verify that the calculated chi-square test statistic matches a known value for a specific set of expected and observed counts. The chi-square statistic is used to determine how well the observed data fits the expected data distribution.

Repair strategy: Ensure that the chi-square calculation in the `chiSquare` method aligns with the expected mathematical formula and that there are no precision or rounding errors, particularly for large values. Given that the failed line is specifically checking the value of the chi-square statistic, the issue likely lies in how the calculation of `sumSq` is handled or possibly in how floating-point operations are performed within the loop. Review and potentially refine the handling of large numbers to prevent overflow or underflow issues, and ensure that division and multiplication operations maintain sufficient precision.
