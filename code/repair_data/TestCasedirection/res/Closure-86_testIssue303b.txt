Intent: The `testIssue303b` is designed to evaluate if the function calls within a JavaScript constructor and its methods correctly handle local and non-local values with respect to function closures and asynchronous callbacks. The test case specifically checks how local references (`self`) are handled when used inside asynchronous callbacks (`setTimeout`), and how they interact with object properties (`self.location`).

Repair strategy: The source code should ensure that the evaluation function (`evaluatesToLocalValue`) can accurately handle and trace object references (`self`) within asynchronous functions and closures. The strategy should include:
1. Enhancing the handling of `Token.THIS` and potentially `Token.FUNCTION` to better manage closures and asynchronous callbacks where `this` could refer to different contexts depending on the scope.
2. Reviewing how properties of objects are evaluated (`Token.GETPROP`) when they are accessed inside asynchronous functions to ensure they are treated as local or non-local correctly.
3. Implementing or refining the logic in cases like `Token.CALL` to accurately determine the locality of results in asynchronous scenarios and callbacks, possibly by tracking the origin of each reference and its modifications through object methods and properties.
