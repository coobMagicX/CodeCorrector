Intent: The intent of the `tryMinimizeIf` method is to simplify and optimize `if` statements in the source code by reducing unnecessary branches, and converting them into more concise expressions like ternary operators or logical operations where possible. The purpose is to achieve cleaner and potentially more efficient code after transformations.

Repair strategy: The problem in the failing test cases appears to be related to handling expressions with side effects correctly during the transformation process. Specifically, the test cases involve pre/post-increment and pre/post-decrement operations within the condition or the branches of the `if` statements. The current implementation may not be adequately considering the order of operations and side effects when transforming these types of expressions. The repair should ensure that:
1. Operations with side effects (like `x++` or `x[--y]`) are handled correctly, preserving the original order and effect when simplifying the `if` statements.
2. Additional checks or conditions might be needed to either avoid transformations when side effects are involved or to correctly replicate the side effects in the transformed code.
3. Review and possibly adjust the logic that determines when it is safe to transform an `if` statement into a ternary operation or a logical operation, ensuring that transformations do not alter the original semantics of the code, especially in the presence of side effects.
