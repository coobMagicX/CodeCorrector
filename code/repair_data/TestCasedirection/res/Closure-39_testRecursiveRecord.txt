Intent: The intent of the failing test case `testRecursiveRecord` is to verify the behavior of the `toStringHelper` method when dealing with recursive structures in object types, specifically ensuring that recursive references within properties are handled correctly without causing infinite loops or incorrect outputs.

Repair strategy: Modify the `toStringHelper` method to properly detect and handle recursive structures. This could involve maintaining a set or map to track objects that have already been processed during the pretty-printing process to avoid revisiting them. When a recursive reference is detected (i.e., an object that is already being processed), the method should output a placeholder (e.g., "{...}") or some indication of recursion (e.g., "?") instead of attempting to fully print the object again, which leads to the recursive loop or incorrect output as indicated by the failed test case.
