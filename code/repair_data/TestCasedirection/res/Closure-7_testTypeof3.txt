Intent: The intent of the test case `testTypeof3` seems to be to assess whether the function `caseObjectType` correctly identifies and handles JavaScript types, particularly focusing on the scenario where a variable is evaluated to be of type `function` using the `typeof` operator in a binary operation (likely equality check).

Repair strategy: The source code should be updated to handle the case where the input type to `caseObjectType` does not directly match the subtypes expected when `value.equals("function")` is true. This involves ensuring that any JavaScript type that can be coerced or interpreted as a function type under JavaScript's dynamic typing is correctly handled. Specifically, the `caseObjectType` method should correctly identify and handle cases where a type is function-like but not strictly a subtype of the native `U2U_CONSTRUCTOR_TYPE`. This could involve adjusting the type checking logic to accommodate broader or different interpretations of what constitutes a subtype or equivalent to a function type in the specific context of the JavaScript environment being simulated.
