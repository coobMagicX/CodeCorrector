Intent: The test case intends to verify that the creation of a new object using the 'new' keyword (e.g., `new x()`) should not be treated as a local value unless there is certainty that the object is not aliased within the constructor.

Repair strategy: Enhance the handling of the 'new' keyword in the source code to ensure that it returns true if and only if it is certain that the newly created object is not aliased internally. This may involve implementing a more sophisticated check or analysis within the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to determine if the constructor aliases the object.
