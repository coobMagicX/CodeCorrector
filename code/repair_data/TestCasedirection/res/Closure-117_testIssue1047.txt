Intent: The test case `testIssue1047` is intended to verify whether the method `getReadableJSTypeName` can accurately identify and handle situations where a property is accessed on an object, but the property is not defined on the object's type. The test checks if the method can correctly handle and report properties that are never defined on the type of the object being referenced.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to ensure that it correctly identifies when a property is not defined on an object's type, particularly in contexts where properties are dynamically accessed (e.g., `this.c2_.prop`). This involves enhancing the error handling and reporting mechanisms within the `getReadableJSTypeName` method to accurately detect and respond to attempts to access undefined properties. The code should include checks to verify property existence before attempting to dereference or return property details, and it should provide appropriate fallback or error messages when properties are missing.
