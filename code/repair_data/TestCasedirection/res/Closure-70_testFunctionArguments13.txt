Intent: The intent of the failed test case `testFunctionArguments13` is to verify that the argument types in a function can handle non-inferrable types correctly. It specifically tests a scenario where a function parameter is initially declared as a specific type (`boolean` in this case) but is later assigned a non-compatible type (`null`) within the function body.

Repair strategy: The source code should include a mechanism to handle or validate type compatibility when assigning new values to function parameters, especially when dealing with nullable or undefined types. This could involve enhancing the `defineSlot` method to include type checks or validations that ensure the assigned type does not violate the declared parameter type, thus preventing type errors. Additionally, the method could be updated to handle cases where the parameter type might be a union type that includes `null` or other types, thereby accommodating assignments like `b = null;` in a type-safe manner.
