Intent: The intent of the failing test case is to verify that the source code can correctly handle the `for each` loop syntax, a language extension not typically supported in standard JavaScript. The test aims to ensure that the parser can either process or correctly reject `for each` loops with a specific error message.

Repair strategy: Modify the source code to include a condition that explicitly checks for the `for each` syntax and ensure that it throws an appropriate error or handles the syntax correctly if intended to be supported. This might involve adding a new case or modifying the existing parsing logic to recognize and differentiate between `for` and `for each` loop constructs. Additionally, ensure that the error message "unsupported language extension: for each" is properly generated when encountering a `for each` loop.
