Intent: The test case `testGlobalQualifiedNameInLocalScope` is intended to verify that a globally qualified name (`ns.foo`) defined within a local function scope is properly registered in the global scope. This test ensures that the variable can be accessed and correctly typed as a function from outside its immediate defining scope.

Repair strategy: Modify the `defineSlot` method to ensure that symbols defined with qualified names (`GETPROP` type nodes) inside local or anonymous functions are correctly declared in the global scope if the symbol is meant to be global. This would involve adjusting the scope resolution logic to detect and handle cases where a qualified name should be globally accessible despite being defined within a local or function scope. This might require additional checks or modifications in how the `scopeToDeclareIn` is determined for qualified names.
