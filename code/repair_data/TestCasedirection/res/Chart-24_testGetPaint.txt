Intent: The method `getPaint(double value)` is intended to generate a grayscale `Color` object based on a provided `value` which is normalized between `lowerBound` and `upperBound`. The color should range from black (for `lowerBound` or below) to white (for `upperBound` or above).

Repair strategy: Refactor the calculation of the grayscale intensity to correctly handle values that are outside the specified bounds (`lowerBound` and `upperBound`). This involves ensuring that the calculation for the grayscale intensity (`g`) uses the clamped value `v` instead of the original `value`. This will ensure that values outside the bounds are correctly mapped to either black or white, depending on whether they are below the lower bound or above the upper bound, respectively.

```java
int g = (int) ((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);
```
Replace `value` with `v` in the calculation of `g` to ensure the intensity is calculated based on the clamped value. This change ensures that the method correctly returns black for values below the lower bound and white for values above the upper bound, aligning with the test expectations.
