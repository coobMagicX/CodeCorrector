Analysis: The purpose of the code is to find the root of a univariate real function using the Regula Falsi method. The intent is to iteratively refine the approximation until a satisfactory solution is found based on specified accuracies and allowed sides.

Reasons for failure at line `final double root = solver.solve(3624, f, 1, 10);`:
1. The test case failed because the actual root value returned by the solver was different from the expected value.
2. The failure could be due to inaccuracies in the solver's implementation of the Regula Falsi method, which led to a different root approximation than expected.
3. There might be issues with the convergence criteria or interval selection in the solver implementation, causing it to converge to a different solution than the expected root value.
4. The chosen initial interval [1, 10] or the maximum number of iterations (3624) might not be suitable for the specific function `Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0)` provided in the test case, leading to a different root estimation.

Overall, the specific failure indicates that the solver's implementation of the Regula Falsi method may need to be reviewed and potentially improved for better accuracy and convergence in certain scenarios.
