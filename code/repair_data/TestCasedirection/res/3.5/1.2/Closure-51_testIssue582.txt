Analysis: The purpose of the `addNumber` method is to format a double number `x` into a string representation. The method handles special cases like negative zero to prevent misparsing and formats large numbers using scientific notation if applicable.

The specific failed line `assertPrint("var x = -0.0;", "var x=-0.0");` indicates that the formatting of negative zero is not working as expected. The expected output should be `var x=-0.0` but the actual output might be different, potentially not handling the negative zero case correctly.

Reason for failure: The condition `(x < 0 && prev == '-')` is used to check if the current number is negative and the previous character was also a minus sign. In the case of `-0.0`, the condition might not be correctly handling the negative zero scenario leading to incorrect formatting.

To fix the issue, the code should be reviewed to ensure that negative zero is handled properly in the formatting logic. This may involve adjusting the condition or adding a specific check for negative zero to ensure it is formatted correctly.
