Analysis: The purpose of the `testParseLicenseAscii` test case is to check the parsing of a license block from a JavaScript comment. The specific failed line `assertEquals(" Foo\n   Bar\n\n  Baz", node.getJSDocInfo().getLicense())` is comparing the expected license text with the actual license text extracted from the comment.

Reason for failure: The reason for the failure could be due to the handling of whitespace characters in the extracted license text. The extraction logic might not be preserving the exact whitespace characters, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual license text. This discrepancy could be caused by how whitespace is trimmed or added during the extraction process, especially when `WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE` is not used consistently. 

To fix the issue, you may need to review and adjust how whitespace is handled during the extraction of multiline textual blocks to ensure that the extracted text matches the expected format, including whitespace characters.
