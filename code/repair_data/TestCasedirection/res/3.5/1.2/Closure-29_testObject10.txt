Analysis: The purpose of the method `isInlinableObject` is to determine if a given list of references represents an object that can be safely inlined. The method iterates over each reference and performs various checks to ensure that the object meets certain criteria for inlining.

The specific failed line `"var x = {}; var b = f(); x = {a:a, b:b}; if(x.a) g(x.b) + x.c"` failed the test case because the method incorrectly returned `false` when encountering the assignment of `x.c = c`. This caused the inlining to be aborted prematurely, leading to the test failure.

The reason for this failure is that the method only allows inlining of object literal assignments and does not handle subsequent assignments to properties of the object. In this case, when `x.c = c` is encountered, the method returns `false` and does not proceed with inlining `x.a` and `x.b`.

To address this issue, the method should be modified to handle subsequent assignments to object properties while still allowing the inlining of the initial object literal assignment.
