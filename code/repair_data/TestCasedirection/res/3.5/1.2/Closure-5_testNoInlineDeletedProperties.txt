Analysis: The purpose of the `testNoInlineDeletedProperties` test case is to verify that deleted properties should not be inlined. The test case creates an object `foo` with property `bar`, deletes the `bar` property, and then tries to access the deleted property `foo.bar`.

Reason for failure: The specific failed line `testSameLocal(` is failing because the test case is expecting the property `bar` to be deleted from the object `foo` and thus the subsequent access `foo.bar` should return `undefined`. However, the current implementation of the `isInlinableObject` method does not handle deleted properties correctly, which leads to the failure of this test case. The method does not account for deleted properties as it only checks for object literal assignments and self-referential assignments, but not specifically for deleted properties.
