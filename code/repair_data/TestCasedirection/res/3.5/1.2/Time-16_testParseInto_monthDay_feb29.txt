Analysis: The purpose of the `parseInto` method is to parse a given text input into an instant and update the provided ReadWritableInstant object accordingly. In this specific case of the failed test case `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29`, the intent is to parse the input "2 29" as the month and day values and set the result instant to February 29, 2004.

Reasons for failure:
1. The test case failed at the specific line `assertEquals(new MutableDateTime(2004, 2, 29, 12, 20, 30, 0, LONDON), result);` because the parsing of the input text "2 29" did not correctly set the instant to February 29, 2004 as expected.
2. The failure could be due to the parsing logic within the `parseInto` method not handling leap years properly or misinterpreting the input values for month and day.

To fix the issue, the parsing logic needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to correctly handle leap years and interpret the input text values accurately.
