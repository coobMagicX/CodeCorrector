Analysis: The purpose of the `greatestCommonDivisor` method is to find the greatest common divisor of two integers using bitwise operations and division. The method handles cases where the operands are positive or negative, and it aims to reduce the integers to their simplest form.

Reasons for failure: The specific failed line `assertEquals(Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2, result.getNumerator());` fails because the `greatestCommonDivisor` method might not handle the case where `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is involved correctly. Since `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest possible integer value in Java and negating it might lead to overflow issues or unexpected behavior, the method may not handle this edge case properly.

To fix this issue, the `greatestCommonDivisor` method should be revised to handle the specific case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` appropriately to avoid arithmetic exceptions or incorrect results when dealing with such extreme values.
