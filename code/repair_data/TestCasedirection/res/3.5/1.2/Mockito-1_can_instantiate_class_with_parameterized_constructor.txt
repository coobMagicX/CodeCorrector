**Analysis:** This method `captureArgumentsFrom` is intended to capture arguments from an `Invocation` object based on certain conditions and matchers provided. The method iterates through the matchers and captures arguments accordingly.

The specific failed line `new FieldInitializer(this, field("noDefaultConstructor"), resolver).initialize();` indicates that the `FieldInitializer` constructor invocation failed in the test case `can_instantiate_class_with_parameterized_constructor`.

**Reasons for failure:** 
1. The failure might be related to the `FieldInitializer` class itself or the way it handles the constructor arguments.
2. The `FieldInitializer` may not be correctly initialized or configured to handle the input parameters provided in the test case.
3. The `resolver` object passed as an argument may not be correctly resolving the type instances as expected by the `FieldInitializer`.

To further investigate and resolve the issue, detailed debugging of the `FieldInitializer` class and its dependencies, as well as the `ConstructorArgumentResolver` implementation, is required.
