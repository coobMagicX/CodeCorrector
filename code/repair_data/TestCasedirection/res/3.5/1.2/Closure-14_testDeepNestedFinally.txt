Analysis: The purpose of the `computeFollowNode` method is to determine the next control flow node to transfer control to based on the current node and its parent in the abstract syntax tree (AST). The method handles various cases such as control transfer to the end of the script, back to the caller of a function, handling return statements, and specific control flow structures like `IF`, `CASE`, `DEFAULT_CASE`, `FOR`, `WHILE`, `DO`, and `TRY`.

The specific failed line `assertCrossEdge(cfg, Token.IF, Token.BLOCK, Branch.ON_EX);` indicates that there was an issue with asserting the cross edge between an `IF` statement and a `BLOCK` node with an exception branch.

Reason for failure: The failure could be due to the implementation of the control flow analysis not handling the specific case of an `IF` statement with an exception branch correctly. It might be possible that the `computeFollowNode` method is not correctly determining the follow node for the `IF` statement in the presence of an exception.

To resolve this failure, you should review the logic in the `computeFollowNode` method related to handling `IF` statements and exception branches. Ensure that the control flow analysis correctly identifies the next node to transfer control to after encountering an `IF` statement with an exception branch. Debugging this specific logic and updating it accordingly should help in passing the failed test case.
