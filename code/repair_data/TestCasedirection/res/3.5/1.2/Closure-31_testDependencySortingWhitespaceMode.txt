Analysis: The purpose of the `testDependencySortingWhitespaceMode` test case is to verify the correct sorting of dependencies in WHITESPACE_ONLY compilation mode. The test case provides input files with `goog.require` and `goog.provide` statements and expects them to be sorted correctly.

The specific failed line `test(new String[] {` indicates that the test case failed to start properly, possibly due to incorrect input formatting or an issue in setting up the test environment.

Possible reasons for the failure of the specific line:
1. Incorrect test input formatting: The input arrays provided to the `test` method may not be correctly formatted, leading to a failure in initializing the test case.
2. Test setup issue: There could be a problem with setting up the test environment or initializing the test scenario, causing the test case to fail at the beginning.

To resolve the issue, you should review the input arrays passed to the `test` method and ensure they are correctly formatted with the expected dependencies for the WHITESPACE_ONLY compilation mode. Additionally, check the test setup code to identify any issues that might be causing the test case to fail at the starting line.
