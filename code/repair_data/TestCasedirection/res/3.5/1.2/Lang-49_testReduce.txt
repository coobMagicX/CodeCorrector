Analysis: The purpose of the `reduce` method is to simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The intent is to return a new `Fraction` object with the simplified values.

The reason the specific line `assertEquals(1, result.getDenominator());` failed is likely due to the method not reducing fractions properly in some cases. This could be caused by issues in the `greatestCommonDivisor` method or the calculation of the reduced numerator and denominator in the `reduce` method. 

To address this issue, it is recommended to review and debug the `reduce` method, ensuring that the greatest common divisor is calculated correctly and that the fraction is reduced properly in all cases. Additionally, checking the implementation of the `getFraction` method to handle negative fractions appropriately might be necessary.
