Analysis: The purpose of the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method is to remove unreferenced function arguments from a function declaration. It checks if the function is a getter or setter key and skips removing arguments in that case. It then iterates over the function arguments and removes any unreferenced arguments from the end of the argument list.

Reason for failure at specific line `test("function foo(a) {}",`: The test case failed because the function `foo` is not modified as expected by the method. This could be due to the function argument `a` being referenced within the function or not being considered for removal due to other conditions not met during the removal process.
