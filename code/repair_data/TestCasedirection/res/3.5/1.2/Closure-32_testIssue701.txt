Analysis: The purpose of the `testIssue701` test case is to check the handling of ASCII art in license comments. The test defines a multiline ASCII art block within a JSDoc comment and expects the result after extraction to match a specific format.

The specific line `assertEquals(result, lastCompiler.toSource());` failed because the extracted result did not match the expected result. This indicates that the extraction logic within the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method did not handle the ASCII art format correctly, leading to a mismatch in the extracted multiline text.

Possible reasons for the failure could be related to how whitespace is handled during extraction, especially when dealing with multiline content and different whitespace options. The trimming and appending of lines within the `builder` may not preserve the ASCII art format as expected, causing discrepancies between the actual extracted text and the expected result. Further investigation and adjustments in the whitespace handling logic may be needed to correctly extract and preserve the ASCII art content.
