Analysis: The purpose of the `injectMockCandidate` method is to inject mocked objects into fields of a given class based on a filter condition. The method iterates over the fields of the class, filters the mock candidates, and then injects them into the fields.

The specific line `assertSame(REFERENCE, illegalInjectionExample.mockShouldNotGoInHere);` failed the test case `mock_should_be_injected_once_and_in_the_best_matching_type`.

Reasons for the failure:
1. The `mockShouldNotGoInHere` field of the `illegalInjectionExample` object did not receive the expected `REFERENCE` object, which resulted in the assertion failure.
2. Possible issues could include incorrect filtering of mock candidates or incorrect injection logic within the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method.

To fix the issue, ensure that the filtering logic correctly identifies the field `mockShouldNotGoInHere` as not suitable for injection and that the expected `REFERENCE` object is not injected into it. Additionally, review the injection logic to ensure that the correct mock objects are injected into the appropriate fields based on the filtering criteria.
