Analysis: The purpose of the `testMath828Cycle` test case is to check the behavior of the SimplexSolver when optimizing a linear objective function with a set of linear constraints. The test aims to minimize the objective function while satisfying the given constraints.

The specific line that failed:
```java
PointValuePair solution = new SimplexSolver().optimize(f, constraints, GoalType.MINIMIZE, true);
```

Reasons for failure:
1. The failure could be due to issues in the implementation of the `SimplexSolver` class or its dependencies, such as the `getPivotRow` method provided in the source code.
2. It is possible that the `getPivotRow` method is not correctly handling degeneracy cases or applying Bland's rule effectively, leading to incorrect optimization results.
3. There could be a bug or edge case in the Simplex algorithm implementation that causes it to fail for certain types of linear programs.
4. The test case may not be specifying the constraints or objective function correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in the optimization process.

To resolve the issue, you may need to debug the `SimplexSolver` class and the `getPivotRow` method to ensure correct handling of degeneracy and proper application of the Simplex algorithm. Additionally, check the validity of the constraints and objective function provided in the test case.
