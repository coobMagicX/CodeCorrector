Analysis: The purpose of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` method is to perform a Cholesky decomposition on a real matrix to obtain a lower triangular matrix. The intent is to decompose the input matrix into a product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose.

The specific line `Assert.assertEquals(0.0, m3.subtract(rebuiltM3).getNorm(), 1.0e-16);` failed in the test case. This failure indicates that the Cholesky decomposition did not result in the expected matrix reconstruction within the specified tolerance.

Reasons for failure:
1. The Cholesky decomposition implementation may not handle corner cases where the input matrix has zeros or lacks full rank properly.
2. The tolerance level specified for the comparison may be too strict, causing small numerical errors in the decomposition to lead to test failures.
3. There could be a bug in the Cholesky decomposition algorithm that leads to incorrect reconstruction of the matrix.

To address the failure, you may need to review the Cholesky decomposition algorithm implementation to handle edge cases and improve numerical stability. Additionally, adjusting the tolerance level for the comparison or debugging the reconstruction process could help identify and fix any issues causing the test failures.
