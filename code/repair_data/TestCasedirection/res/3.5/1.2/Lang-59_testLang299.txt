Analysis: The purpose of the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method is to append a string with padding characters to the right side of the current `StrBuilder` instance. The intent is to ensure that the resulting string has a fixed width specified by the `width` parameter, padding with the `padChar` character if necessary.

Reasons for failure: In the specific failed test case, the line `sb.appendFixedWidthPadRight("foo", 1, '-');` failed because the expected result was "f" but the actual result was different. 

The reason for this failure is that the method does not handle the case where the input string is longer than the specified width. In such cases, it directly copies the input string without considering the width constraint. This results in the padding characters not being added as expected, leading to an incorrect output. 

To fix this issue, the method should truncate the input string if its length exceeds the specified width and then add padding characters to meet the desired width.
