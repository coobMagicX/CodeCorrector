Analysis: The purpose of the `add` method is to append a new code snippet to an existing code string with certain conditions. The specific failed line is related to handling forward slashes in the code snippet.

Reasons for failure:
1. The condition `(isWordChar(c) || c == '\\') && isWordChar(getLastChar())` in the code is not handling the forward slashes correctly.
2. The test case is expecting the forward slashes to be handled differently than how the code is currently processing them, resulting in the mismatch between the expected output and the actual output. 

To fix this issue, the condition related to handling forward slashes needs to be revised in the code to match the expected behavior in the test cases.
