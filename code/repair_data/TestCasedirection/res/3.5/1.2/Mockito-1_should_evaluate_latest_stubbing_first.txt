Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an `Invocation` object and process them based on certain conditions. The specific failed line in the test case is trying to stub a method call on a mock object to return a specific value when the method `objectReturningMethod` is called with the argument `200`.

The reason this specific line failed could be due to the logic inside the `captureArgumentsFrom` method not handling the stubbing properly for the argument `200`. This could be caused by issues such as incorrect matching of matchers, improper processing of varargs, or not capturing and processing the arguments correctly in the method. Further debugging and analysis within the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is needed to identify the exact reason for the failure.
