Analysis: The purpose of the `compareTo` method is to compare two Fraction objects based on their double values. The intent is to return -1 if the calling object is less than the argument object, 0 if they are equal, and +1 if the calling object is greater than the argument object.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(-1, pi1.compareTo(pi2));` failed because the comparison between `pi1` and `pi2` did not return the expected result of -1. This failure could be due to precision issues when converting fractions to double values, leading to inaccuracies in the comparison. Since fractions are approximations and can result in slight differences in double representations, comparing them directly using double values may not always yield the correct result. 

To address this issue, you may need to implement a more robust comparison method for fractions that takes into account the potential rounding errors when converting fractions to doubles. This could involve comparing the fractions directly instead of relying solely on their double values.
