Analysis: This method `replaceAssignmentExpression` is intended to replace assignment expressions in a given JavaScript code snippet with new assignments based on a provided variable map. The specific failed line `testLocal("var a; a = {}", "true");` indicates that the test case is expecting the replacement of the assignment expression `"a = {}"` with a new assignment that evaluates to "true".

Reasons for failure:
1. The method is not handling the scenario where the assigned value is an object literal `{}` correctly. The line `Preconditions.checkState(val.getType() == Token.OBJECTLIT);` is expecting the assigned value to be an object literal, but it seems that the replacement logic is not correctly generating the expected result for this case.

2. The logic for creating the replacement nodes using `Token.ASSIGN` and `Token.COMMA` nodes might not be generating the correct expression tree that evaluates to "true" for the provided assignment `"a = {}"`.

To address the failure, the method logic for handling assignment expressions with object literals should be reviewed and adjusted to correctly generate the expected replacement nodes that evaluate to "true" for the specific test case.
