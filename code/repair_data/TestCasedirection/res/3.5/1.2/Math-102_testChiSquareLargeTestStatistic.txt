Analysis: The purpose of the `chiSquare` method is to calculate the chi-square test statistic based on the expected and observed values provided. The intent is to compare the observed data with the expected data to test for independence or goodness of fit in statistical analysis.

The specific failed line `assertEquals( "chi-square test statistic",` failed because the actual chi-square test statistic calculated by the method did not match the expected value specified in the test case.

Reason for failure:
The failure in the specific line occurred because the chi-square test statistic calculation in the `chiSquare` method has a flaw. The issue is likely related to how the sum of squared differences between observed and expected values is calculated. In the formula `sumSq += dev * dev / expected[i];`, there might be a mistake in the computation that leads to an incorrect chi-square test statistic result.

To resolve the issue, the calculation of the chi-square test statistic within the `chiSquare` method needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure the correct calculation of the test statistic based on the given expected and observed values.
