Analysis: The purpose of the `add` method is to add a specific value to a partial date represented as an array of values. In case the value to add is 0, it simply returns the original values array. If the partial date is contiguous (e.g., month-day), it iterates over the partial fields, calculates the new instant by adding the value, and then returns the updated date. Otherwise, it falls back to the superclass implementation.

The specific failed line `MonthDay result = test.plusMonths(-1);` failed in the test case `testPlusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` where it was expected to subtract 1 month from a specific date. The failure indicates that the calculation of subtracting months might not be handled correctly in the `add` method.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `add` method does not handle subtracting months correctly, which could be due to a miscalculation or a bug in the logic for subtracting the value.
2. The method may not be properly accounting for edge cases like leap years or specific month lengths, leading to incorrect results when subtracting months from a date like 29th of February.
