Analysis: The intent of the `escapeRegex` method is to escape special characters in a given string for regex processing. The method iterates over each character in the input string and escapes specific characters if they are part of a predefined list. However, the method fails to properly handle the case when a space character needs to be escaped.

The specific failed line `testSdfAndFdp("M E","3  Tue", true);` failed because the method did not handle multiple consecutive whitespace characters correctly. In this case, the input string "3  Tue" contains two consecutive spaces that should be escaped as `\\s*+`, but the method only escapes the first space and fails to properly escape the second space.

To fix this issue, the method should be modified to correctly escape consecutive whitespace characters by updating the logic related to handling whitespace characters in the input string.
