Analysis: The purpose of the `toStringHelper` method is to generate a string representation of an object type, either in a pretty-printed format or a concise format. The failed line `assertEquals("{loop: ?, number: number, string: string}",` suggests that the pretty-printing of the `loop` property did not occur as expected, resulting in an unexpected output with a question mark instead of the actual representation.

Reasons for failure: The failure in pretty-printing the `loop` property with a question mark instead of the actual representation could be due to the `getPropertyType(property).toString()` method not handling the case where the property value is another object type (in this case, `loop` being a `ProxyObjectType`). The `toString` method of the `ProxyObjectType` class may not be properly implemented to provide a meaningful string representation, leading to the unexpected output with a question mark. To resolve this issue, the `toString` method of `ProxyObjectType` should be implemented or updated to return a proper string representation of the object type.
