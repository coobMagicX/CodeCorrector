Analysis: The purpose of the `checkPropertyVisibility` method is to enforce visibility rules for properties in JavaScript code. It checks the visibility of properties and reports errors if there are violations of visibility rules.

Reasons for the specific failed line:
- In the failed test case `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties6`, the test is trying to override a private property `bar_` in a different file, which should cause a `BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS` error according to the visibility rules implemented in the method.
- The failed line `test(new String[] {` is the start of defining the input for the test case, where it is attempting to define two constructor functions `Foo` and `SubFoo` with properties `bar_`, and the test is not handling the private property access correctly.

To fix this issue, the visibility rules in the `checkPropertyVisibility` method need to be correctly enforced to detect and report the violation of accessing a private property in a different file. The test case input should be adjusted to ensure that the violation of private property access is properly tested and detected.
