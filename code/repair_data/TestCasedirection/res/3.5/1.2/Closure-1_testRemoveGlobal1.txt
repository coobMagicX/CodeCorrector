Analysis: The purpose of the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method is to remove unreferenced function arguments from a function declaration. The intent is to optimize the code by eliminating unused arguments.

The specific failed line `test("var y=function(x){var z;}", "var y=function(x){}");` failed because the method did not successfully remove the unreferenced function argument `z` from the function `y`.

The reason for the failure could be that the `referenced.contains(var)` condition did not correctly identify `var z` as unreferenced, leading to the argument not being removed. This could be due to a problem with how the `referenced` set is populated or how the check for references is implemented. Further debugging and refinement of the logic for identifying and removing unreferenced arguments may be necessary to address this issue.
