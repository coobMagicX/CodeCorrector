Analysis: The purpose of the `testPerformClusterAnalysisDegenerate` test case is to verify the clustering functionality of the `KMeansPlusPlusClusterer` using EuclideanIntegerPoint objects. The specific failed line `List<Cluster<EuclideanIntegerPoint>> clusters = transformer.cluster(Arrays.asList(points), 1, 1);` indicates that the cluster method did not behave as expected.

Reason for failure: The failure could be due to the way the `distance` method calculates the distance between two points. Since the `distance` method calculates the Euclidean distance between two points by summing the squared differences of each coordinate, it might not be suitable for clustering EuclideanIntegerPoint objects directly. This could lead to incorrect clustering results, causing the test to fail.

To address this issue, consider implementing a custom distance calculation method specific to EuclideanIntegerPoint objects or modifying the `distance` method to handle integer coordinates appropriately for clustering purposes.
