Analysis: The intent of the `testWith3` test case is to verify the behavior of the `with` method when trying to set a new value for a specific DateTimeFieldType in a Partial object. The specific failed line `fail();` indicates that the test failed to throw an IllegalArgumentException when setting the value for a DateTimeFieldType that does not exist in the original Partial object.

The reason for the failure at the `fail();` line could be because the `with` method implementation does not throw an IllegalArgumentException when trying to set a value for a DateTimeFieldType that is not present in the original Partial object. This could be due to a missing validation check for the existence of the specified DateTimeFieldType in the `with` method implementation.
