Analysis: The purpose of the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method is to remove unreferenced function arguments from a given function scope. The intent is to optimize the code by removing unused arguments from function declarations. The specific failed line `test("function x(){function y(x){var z;}y()}"` failed because the test case expects the function argument `z` to be removed when it is unreferenced.

Reasons for failure: The test case failed because the `removeUnreferencedFunctionArgs` method did not correctly remove the unreferenced function argument `z` from the inner function `y` within the function `x`. This could be due to a logic error in the method that handles the removal of unreferenced arguments, or it might be related to how the method identifies and removes unreferenced variables within nested function scopes. Further investigation into the logic of how unreferenced function arguments are identified and removed is needed to address this failure.
