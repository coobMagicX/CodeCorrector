Analysis: The purpose of the `hasSameMethod` method is to compare whether two invocations have the same method. The specific failed line `Assert.assertNotNull(((Iterable) iterable).iterator());` in the test case `shouldStubbingWork` fails because it is trying to access the iterator of an `iterable` object but the casting to `Iterable` is causing a class cast exception.

Reasons for failure: 
1. The `iterable` object is not of type `Iterable`, and casting it to `Iterable` is causing a class cast exception.
2. The `iterable` object might not have been properly initialized or stubbed in the test case, leading to a `NullPointerException` when trying to access its iterator.
