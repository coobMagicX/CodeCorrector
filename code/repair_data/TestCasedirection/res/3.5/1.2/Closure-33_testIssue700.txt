Analysis: The purpose of the `matchConstraint` method is to iterate over properties of a record type constraint object and infer their types if they are not already declared. The failed test case indicates an issue with the `testTypes(` method being called, which is not directly related to the `matchConstraint` method.

Reason for failure: The specific failed line `testTypes(` in the test case `testIssue700` is likely failing due to a missing implementation or incorrect usage of the `testTypes` method in the test setup or framework. The failure is not within the `matchConstraint` method itself but rather in the test infrastructure or setup.

It seems that the test case is attempting to test some JavaScript functions and their type annotations, but the issue lies in how the test is being executed rather than any problem within the `matchConstraint` method. Further debugging of the test setup and the `testTypes` method implementation is needed to address this specific failure.
