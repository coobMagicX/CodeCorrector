Analysis: The purpose of the function `canInlineReferenceDirectly` is to determine whether it is possible to inline a function call directly into the calling context. The function checks if direct call node replacement is possible and then analyzes the arguments and parameters of the function call and function definition to determine if inlining can be done.

The specific failed line `helperCanInlineReferenceToFunction(CanInlineResult.NO,` indicates that the test case `testIssue1101a` expects the function `canInlineReferenceDirectly` to return `CanInlineResult.NO` for a specific scenario involving the function call to `foo` in the code snippet provided.

Reason for failure: The failure of the test case could be due to the conditions in the function not correctly identifying that the function call to `foo` cannot be inlined directly. There might be issues with how the arguments and parameters are being compared or how side effects and mutable states are being evaluated within the function.

To fix the issue, you may need to review and debug the logic within the `canInlineReferenceDirectly` function to ensure that it correctly handles the scenario where inlining is not possible and returns `CanInlineResult.NO` as expected in the failed test case.
