Analysis: The purpose of the `performArithmeticOp` method is to perform arithmetic operations on two operands and return the result in a Node object. The specific line that failed in the test case "x = 1 / 0" aims to handle the division operation when the divisor is 0.

Reasons for failure:
1. The line failed because the method does not correctly handle the division by zero scenario.
2. In the case of division by zero (rval == 0), the method should raise an error or handle it in a specific way, but it currently returns null which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, you can update the code to handle the division by zero case appropriately, such as throwing an error or handling it according to the desired behavior.
