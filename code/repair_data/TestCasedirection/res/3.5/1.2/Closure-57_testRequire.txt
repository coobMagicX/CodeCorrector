Analysis: The purpose of the `extractClassNameIfGoog` method is to extract the class name from a given node if it matches a specific function name. The method checks if the parent node is a call expression and if the callee is a GETPROP node with a qualified name matching the provided function name.

The specific failed line `assertNotRequire("goog.require(foo)");` failed because the input string does not have quotes around the module name. This caused the method to not find a matching qualified name and therefore not extract the class name, resulting in a failure.

The reason for the failure is that the method expects the input string to have the module name enclosed in single or double quotes, as in `'foo'`. Without the quotes, the method cannot correctly identify the qualified name and extract the class name.
