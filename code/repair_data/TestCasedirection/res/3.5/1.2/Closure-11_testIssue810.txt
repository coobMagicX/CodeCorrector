Analysis: The purpose of the `visitGetProp` method is to handle property access in JavaScript code. It checks the type of the object on the left side of the property access expression and reports errors if necessary. The method also ensures type checking.

The specific failed line `testTypes(` in the test case indicates a failure in invoking the `testTypes` method with incorrect arguments or setup. This failure could be due to missing or incorrect test setup, incorrect input parameters, or issues with the testing framework configuration.

It is important to review the test setup and input parameters provided in the test case to ensure they align with the expected behavior of the `visitGetProp` method. Additionally, checking the implementation of the `testTypes` method and its interactions with the `visitGetProp` method might help identify the exact cause of the failure.
