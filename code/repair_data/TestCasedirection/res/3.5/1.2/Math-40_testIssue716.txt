Analysis: The purpose of the code is to implement a solver using the Bracketing Nth Order Brent method to find the root of a univariate function within a given interval. The intent is to iteratively refine the bracketing interval to locate the root accurately.

The specific failed line `double result = solver.solve(100, sharpTurn, -0.9999999, 30, 15, AllowedSolution.RIGHT_SIDE);` failed due to the incorrect usage of the solver parameters or the function behavior within the specified interval. The failure could be due to the nature of the sharp turn in the function `sharpTurn`, which might be causing issues during the root finding process. Additionally, the chosen parameters for the solver may not be suitable for this specific function, resulting in the failure of the test case.
