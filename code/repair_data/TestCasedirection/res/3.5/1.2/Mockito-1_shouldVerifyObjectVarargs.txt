Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and handle varargs if present. The specific failed line `verify(mock).withObjectVarargs(1);` indicates that the verification for a method call with specific arguments failed.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed because the `captureArgumentsFrom` method does not properly handle the verification for a method call with varargs arguments. The method implementation needs to be updated to correctly capture and handle varargs arguments during verification.
