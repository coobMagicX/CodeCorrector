Analysis: The purpose of the `evaluatesToLocalValue` method is to determine if a given node evaluates to a local value based on certain conditions. The method handles different types of nodes and checks if they are considered local values according to the logic provided in each case.

The specific failed line `checkMarkedCalls("/** @constructor A */ function A() {};` failed because it is part of a test case where the method should correctly identify if a local object has been modified and returned, which should not be considered a global side-effect. The failure indicates that the method may not be properly handling the case of a modified local object being returned.

The failure could be due to the method not correctly identifying the modified local object `a` as a local value after the assignment `a.foo = 1`, which results in a false positive for a global side-effect. This could be caused by a missing check or incorrect logic in the handling of assignments and modifications to objects within the method. Further debugging and adjustment of the logic for handling object modifications and returns may be needed to address this failure.
