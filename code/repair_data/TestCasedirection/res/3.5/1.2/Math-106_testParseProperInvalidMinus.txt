Analysis: The purpose of the specific failed line is to indicate that there is an invalid minus sign in an improper fraction during parsing.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the code logic does not handle cases where there are invalid minus signs in the input string representing an improper fraction. The code is expecting the minus sign to be leading before the whole number, numerator, or denominator, but the test cases provided have minus signs in incorrect positions within the input strings. As a result, the parsing fails to recognize these cases as valid input and does not handle them properly, leading to the test failure.
