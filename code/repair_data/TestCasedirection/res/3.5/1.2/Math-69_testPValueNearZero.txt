Analysis: The purpose of the `testPValueNearZero` test case is to verify that the p-values calculated by the `getCorrelationPValues` method do not vanish for increasing dimensions and that they diminish smoothly. The specific assertion that failed is checking that the p-value for correlation between variables at indices 0 and 1 is greater than 0.

Reason for failure: The specific line `assertTrue(corrInstance.getCorrelationPValues().getEntry(0, 1) > 0);` failed because the calculated p-value for the correlation between variables at indices 0 and 1 is not greater than 0 as expected. This indicates an issue with how the p-values are being calculated in the `getCorrelationPValues` method, causing them to be incorrect for the given input data. The failure suggests a problem with the calculation of p-values for high dimensions in the correlation matrix.
