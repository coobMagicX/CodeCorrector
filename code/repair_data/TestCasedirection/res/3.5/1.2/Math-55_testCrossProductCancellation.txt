Analysis: The purpose of the crossProduct method is to compute the cross product of two 3D vectors. The intent is to handle precision and cancellation errors by rescaling the input vectors.

The specific failed line `checkVector(Vector3D.crossProduct(v1, v2), -1, 2, 1);` failed due to precision issues in the computation of the cross product. The method fails to handle the cancellation errors when subtracting the vectors `v1` and `rho v2`, leading to incorrect results when computing the cross product. This results in the test cases not matching the expected values.

To address this issue, the method should be reviewed to ensure proper handling of precision when rescaling the vectors and computing the cross product to avoid cancellation errors. Additional checks and adjustments may be needed to improve the accuracy of the cross product computation.
