Analysis: The purpose of the `testXYAutoRange2` test case is to check the auto range functionality of a `NumberAxis` in a scatter plot. The test sets up a series of data points and creates a scatter plot chart, then configures the range axis to not include zero and checks the lower and upper bounds of the axis.

Specific failed line: The specific failed line is `JFreeChart chart = ChartFactory.createScatterPlot(`.

Reason for failure: The failure does not seem to be related to the line `JFreeChart chart = ChartFactory.createScatterPlot(` itself, but rather an issue with the setup or configuration of the chart or the range axis that leads to the subsequent assertions failing. The failure might be due to incorrect setup of the dataset, plot, or axis configurations affecting the expected lower and upper bounds of the range axis. Further analysis of the test setup and configurations is needed to identify the root cause of the failure.
