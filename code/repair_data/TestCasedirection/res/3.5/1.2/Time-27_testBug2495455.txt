Analysis: The purpose of the `toFormatter` method is to create a `PeriodFormatter` based on the provided list of element pairs and certain flags (`notPrinter` and `notParser`). The method handles different scenarios based on the flags and the elements in the list to construct the appropriate `PeriodFormatter`.

Reasons for failure:
The specific failed line `pfmt2.parsePeriod("PT1003199059S");` failed because the `pfmt2` formatter was not able to parse the period `"PT1003199059S"`. This failure might be due to an issue in the construction of `pfmt2` in the test case or an issue with the `toFormatter` method when creating the formatter for `pfmt2`.
