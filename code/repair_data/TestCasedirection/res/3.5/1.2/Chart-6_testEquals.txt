Analysis: The purpose of the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class is to check if two `ShapeList` objects are equal by comparing their contents. The method first checks if the objects are the same reference, then verifies if the object is an instance of `ShapeList`, and finally calls the superclass `equals` method for comparison.

The specific failed line `assertTrue(l1.equals(l2));` failed because the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class is not correctly comparing the contents of the `ShapeList` objects. In this case, even though both `l1` and `l2` have the same shapes added in the same order, the `equals` method is likely not comparing the shapes properly within the `ShapeList`.

To fix this issue, the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class should be updated to iterate over the shapes in the list and compare each shape individually to ensure that the contents of the `ShapeList` objects are equal.
