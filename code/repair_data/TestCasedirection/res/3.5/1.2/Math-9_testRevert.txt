Analysis: The intent of the `revert` method is to create a new `Line` object with the direction vector negated. The specific line that failed the test is trying to compare the expected negated direction vector with the direction vector of the reverted line using `assertArrayEquals`.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed because the `revert` method implementation is not correctly negating the direction vector as expected. The failure in the test case indicates that the direction vector of the reverted line is not the negation of the original direction vector, which means there is an issue with the calculation or logic in the `revert` method. The failure could be due to an error in the subtraction operation in the `revert` method or incorrect handling of vector negation.
