Analysis: The purpose of the code snippet is to read type variables for a given type variable and register them. The failed test case is trying to mock deep nested method calls on a mocked object of `MyClass1` and set a return value for a method call chain.

The specific failed line `when(myMock1.getNested().getNested().returnSomething()).thenReturn("Hello World.");` failed because the method calls `getNested().getNested().returnSomething()` on the mocked object `myMock1` are not properly stubbed or defined.

Potential reasons for the failure:
1. The method calls `getNested().getNested().returnSomething()` might not have been properly set up for mocking with `when().thenReturn()` in the test case setup.
2. The nested method calls might not be returning valid mock objects or the chain of method calls is not correctly defined for the mock object `myMock1`.
3. There could be issues with the way deep stubs are configured for the mock object `myMock1` using `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS`.

To fix the issue, ensure that the deep method calls on the mocked object are properly stubbed and the chain of method calls is correctly defined in the test case setup. Additionally, verify that the deep stubs configuration is appropriate for the mocking scenario.
