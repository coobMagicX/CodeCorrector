Analysis: The purpose of the `getInitialDomain` method is to calculate and return the initial domain value based on the denominator degrees of freedom. The intent is to use this value in further computations related to distributions.

Reasons for the specific failed line `double x = fd.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);`:
1. In the failed test case `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom`, the denominator degrees of freedom is set to 2.0, which leads to a scenario where `d` in the `getInitialDomain` method becomes 2.0.
2. The formula used in the `getInitialDomain` method is `d / (d - 2.0)`. When `d` is 2.0, this formula results in a division by zero error, which can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results when trying to calculate the initial domain value.
3. This division by zero error can propagate to the computation of `inverseCumulativeProbability` in the failed test case, causing the specific line `double x = fd.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);` to fail due to the incorrect value of `p` derived from the division by zero in the `getInitialDomain` method.

To address this issue, you may need to handle the scenario where the denominator degrees of freedom result in a division by zero error in the `getInitialDomain` method to prevent incorrect computations and ensure proper functionality of the distribution calculations.
