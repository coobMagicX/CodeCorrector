Analysis: The intent of the `testParseInto_monthOnly_parseEndYear` test case is to validate the parsing of a month from the input text and set the parsed value as the month of the year while keeping the other fields of the `MutableDateTime` instance unchanged. The failed specific line `assertEquals(new MutableDateTime(2004, 12, 31, 12, 20, 30, 0, TOKYO), result);` checks if the parsing correctly sets the month to December in the year 2004.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the parsing logic in the `parseInto` method did not correctly handle setting the month value from the input text. This could be due to an issue in parsing the month value "12" from the text "12" and setting it as the month component in the `MutableDateTime` result instance. The failure could be related to how the parsing logic interprets and processes the input text representing the month.
