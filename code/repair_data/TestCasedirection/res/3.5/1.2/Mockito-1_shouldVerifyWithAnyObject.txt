Analysis: The purpose of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method is to capture arguments from an invocation and pass them to matchers that implement the `CapturesArguments` interface. The specific line that failed in the test case is trying to verify that the `varArgs` method of a `Foo` object is called with an array of `String` objects using Mockito's `anyObject()` matcher.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the `captureArgumentsFrom` method does not handle varargs properly. When the method encounters a varargs parameter, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` instead of capturing and processing the varargs arguments. This leads to incorrect argument verification in the test case. To fix this issue, the method should be updated to correctly handle varargs parameters and pass them to the matchers implementing `CapturesArguments`.
