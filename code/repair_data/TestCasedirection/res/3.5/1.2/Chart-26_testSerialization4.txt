Analysis: The purpose of the failed test case `testSerialization4` is to serialize and deserialize a JFreeChart object and then check if the deserialized chart is equal to the original chart. The specific failed line `assertTrue(passed);` is meant to verify that the chart is still usable after serialization and deserialization.

Reasons for the specific line failure: The specific line `assertTrue(passed);` failed because the variable `passed` was set to `false` in the catch block inside the try-catch statement where the chart was attempted to be created as a BufferedImage. This means that an exception occurred during the creation of the BufferedImage for the deserialized chart, causing the test to fail.
