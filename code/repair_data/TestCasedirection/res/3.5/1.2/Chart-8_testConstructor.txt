Analysis: The purpose of the constructor `Week(Date time, TimeZone zone)` is to create a Week object based on the given date and time zone. The constructor is intended to initialize the Week object with the default time zone and locale.

Reasons for the specific failed line `assertEquals(35, w.getWeek());`:
1. The failed line is expecting the week number to be 35 based on the provided date and time zone.
2. However, the constructor implementation inside the `Week` class is not correctly handling the time zone passed as an argument, resulting in a discrepancy in the week calculation.
3. The constructor is not using the provided time zone `TimeZone.getTimeZone("Europe/Copenhagen")` properly while calculating the week number.
4. This leads to the week number being calculated incorrectly, causing the test to fail when expecting 35 but getting a different result.

To fix the issue, the constructor implementation should correctly use the provided time zone when determining the week number based on the given date.
