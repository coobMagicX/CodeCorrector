Analysis: The purpose of the `testLongToString` test case is to verify the behavior of the `toString` and `toAnnotationString` methods for a `RecordType` object with a large number of properties. The failed line `assertEquals("{a1: number, a2: number, a3: number, a4: number, ...}", record.toString());` indicates that the `toString` method did not handle the case where the number of properties exceeds the `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` limit as expected.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the `toString` method did not append `", ..."` when reaching the maximum number of pretty printed properties. The implementation did not properly handle the truncation of properties in the output string when the limit is exceeded. This caused the test case to fail as the expected output did not match the actual output.
