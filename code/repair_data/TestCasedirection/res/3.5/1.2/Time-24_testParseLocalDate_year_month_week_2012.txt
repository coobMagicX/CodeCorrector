Analysis: This method `computeMillis` is responsible for computing the milliseconds based on the input fields and text. The specific failed line is trying to compare the parsed LocalDate object with an expected LocalDate object.

Reasons for failure: The failed test case is failing because the expected LocalDate object is created with day 2 (2nd of January), while the input text is "2012-01-01" which represents the 1st of January. This discrepancy in the expected and actual values is causing the test case to fail.
