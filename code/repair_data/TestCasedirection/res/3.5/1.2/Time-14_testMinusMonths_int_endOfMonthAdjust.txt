Analysis: This method is intended to add a value to a specified field in a partial date representation. The specific failed line failed because the method did not correctly handle the adjustment of the end of the month when subtracting months.

Reasons for failure: The failed test case "testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust" is testing the behavior of subtracting a month from a MonthDay object where the initial date is the last day of a month (March 31st). The expected result is to have the date adjusted to the last day of the previous month (February 29th). However, the test failed at the assertion point because the implementation of the method did not handle the end of the month adjustment correctly when subtracting months. The method did not adjust the day to the last day of February in this scenario, resulting in the test failure.
