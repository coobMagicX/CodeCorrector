Analysis: The purpose of the `visitGetProp` method is to handle property access on an object node in JavaScript. It checks the type of the object node and reports any illegal property access or missing properties.

The specific failed line `testTypes("var x = null; x.prop = 3;",` failed because it is trying to access a property (`prop`) on a null object (`x`), which is not allowed. The failure is caused by the condition `validator.expectNotNullOrUndefined(t, n, childType, "No properties on this expression", getNativeType(OBJECT_TYPE))` in the `visitGetProp` method. The method expects the object node (`x`) to be not null or undefined before allowing property access, but in this case, it is null, leading to the failure of the test case.
