Analysis: The purpose of the `replaceEach` method is to replace multiple search strings in a given text with corresponding replacement strings. The specific failed line is attempting to replace "a" with "c" and "b" with `null` in the text "aba" which should result in "cbc".

Reasons for failure:
1. The specific line failed because the replacementList array contains a `null` value at the index corresponding to "b".
2. When attempting to replace "b" with `null`, the method does not handle the `null` value properly and this leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, the code should check for `null` values in the replacementList array and handle them appropriately, possibly by skipping the replacement for that specific search string.
