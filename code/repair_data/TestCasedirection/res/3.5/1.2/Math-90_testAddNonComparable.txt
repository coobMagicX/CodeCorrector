Analysis: The purpose of the `addValue` method is to increment the frequency count of a given value in a frequency table. It includes a check to ensure that the provided value is comparable to the existing values in the table. The specific failed line `f.addValue(new Object());` failed in the test case `testAddNonComparable` because it did not throw an expected `ClassCastException`.

Reasons for failure: The specific line failed because the method did not throw a `ClassCastException` as expected. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the method is catching `ClassCastException` internally and converting it into an `IllegalArgumentException` with a specific message. Therefore, the test case is not catching the expected exception type, leading to the failure. 

To resolve this issue, the test case should be updated to handle `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `ClassCastException` for values that are not comparable to the existing values in the frequency table. Alternatively, the `addValue` method can be modified to throw a `ClassCastException` directly when the value is not comparable.
