Analysis: The purpose of the `isValidDefineValue` method is to determine if a given Node representing a value is a valid define value based on its type and whether it is present in the set of defines. The method returns true for certain types of values and checks if a Name value is in the set of defines.

The specific failed line `test(` in the failed test case `testOverridingString1()` indicates a failure in the test setup or execution rather than a failure in the `isValidDefineValue` method. The issue seems to be related to the test method or framework being used to compare the expected and actual results of the code transformation. It could be due to incorrect test input data or mismatch in the expected and actual transformed code strings.

To correct this issue, you may need to review the test setup, input data, and comparison logic in the test case `testOverridingString1()` to ensure that the test is correctly verifying the transformation of the define value.
