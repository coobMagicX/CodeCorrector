Analysis: The purpose of the `isSimpleNumber` method is to check if a given string consists of only numerical characters and does not start with a zero. The specific failed line in the test case indicates a failure to handle spaces in the input string correctly.

Reasons for failure: The `isSimpleNumber` method does not account for spaces in the input string. In the failed test case "var x = {0: 1};", the method fails to recognize the space between the characters '=' and '{', causing the validation to fail. To address this issue, you may need to modify the method to trim the input string before processing it, so that spaces do not affect the validation logic.
