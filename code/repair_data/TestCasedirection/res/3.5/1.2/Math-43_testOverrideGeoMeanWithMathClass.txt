Analysis: The purpose of the `addValue` method is to increment various statistical values like sum, square sum, minimum, maximum, log sum, mean, variance, geometric mean, and count based on the input value. The method also handles the case where mean, variance, or geometric mean implementations have been overridden. 

The specific failed line `Assert.assertEquals((new GeometricMean()).evaluate(scores), stats.getGeometricMean(), 0);` in the `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` test case is trying to verify that the `GeometricMean` implementation in the `SummaryStatistics` class correctly calculates the geometric mean for a set of scores.

Reason for failure: The test case failed at the specific line because the `getGeometricMean` method of the `SummaryStatistics` class is not returning the expected geometric mean value calculated by the `GeometricMean` implementation provided in the test case setup. This discrepancy might be due to how the `getGeometricMean` method is implemented or how the `GeometricMean` implementation is used or set in the `SummaryStatistics` class. 

To resolve the issue, you should review how the `getGeometricMean` method retrieves and calculates the geometric mean value in the `SummaryStatistics` class and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior of the `GeometricMean` implementation. Additionally, check if the `setGeoMeanImpl` method is correctly setting the `GeometricMean` implementation in the `SummaryStatistics` class for proper calculation.
