Analysis: The purpose of the `indexOf` method is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given string within the `StrBuilder` object starting from a specified index. The method should return -1 if the string is not found.

The specific failed line `assertEquals(-1, sb.indexOf("three"))` indicates that the test case is expecting the index of the string "three" within the `StrBuilder` object to be -1 after the `deleteFirst("three")` operation. However, the test is failing, which means the actual result is different.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `indexOf` method implementation may not be correctly handling the case when the entire string is deleted from the `StrBuilder` using the `deleteFirst` method. This could lead to incorrect index calculations.
2. There might be a bug in the logic of the `indexOf` method where it is not properly updating the internal buffer after deleting the string "three".
3. The `indexOf` method may not be considering the case when the string to find is an empty string, resulting in incorrect index calculation.

To fix the issue, you should review the logic in the `indexOf` method, especially after string deletions, and ensure that it correctly handles all edge cases including when the string to find is deleted.
