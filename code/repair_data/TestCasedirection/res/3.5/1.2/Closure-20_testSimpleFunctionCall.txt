Analysis: The purpose of the `tryFoldSimpleFunctionCall` method is to optimize simple function calls by folding them into specific expressions, in this case replacing `String(a)` with `'' + (a)`. The method checks if the function call is to the `String` function, and if so, it creates a new addition node with an empty string and the argument, then replaces the original call with this addition.

Reasons for failure of specific line `testSame("var a = String('hello', bar());");`:
- The specific line failed because the `tryFoldSimpleFunctionCall` method is designed to optimize simple function calls to `String` with only one argument. The test case `String('hello', bar());` has multiple arguments which the method does not account for.
- The method only considers the next node after the call target as the value to be used in the addition operation. In this case, `bar()` is not processed as it is not handled by the optimization logic.

To fix this failure, the `tryFoldSimpleFunctionCall` method needs to be updated to handle function calls with multiple arguments if such cases are expected to be optimized.
