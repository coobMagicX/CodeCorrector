Analysis: The purpose of the `atan2` method is to compute the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments. The specific line `Assert.assertEquals(0, pp.getValue(), 1.0e-15);` is testing the result of `atan2` for special cases involving positive and negative zeros.

Reason for failure: The specific line failed because the implementation of the `atan2` method does not handle special cases of positive and negative zero correctly. The failure indicates that the method is not correctly handling the edge cases involving positive and negative zero inputs, which results in incorrect output values for these cases.
