Analysis: The purpose of the `testMath713NegativeVariable` test case is to verify the behavior of the `SimplexSolver` when dealing with negative variables. The intent is to check if the solution obtained from the optimization process ensures that both decision variables are non-negative.

The specific failed line `Assert.assertTrue(Precision.compareTo(solution.getPoint()[1], 0.0d, epsilon) >= 0);` failed because the second decision variable (index 1) in the obtained solution is not guaranteed to be non-negative as expected.

Reasons for failure: The failure could be due to how the solver handles negative variables in the optimization process. In the `getSolution` method of the `SimplexSolver`, the coefficients are calculated based on basic rows and columns. If a variable is unconstrained but still part of the objective function, its coefficient is set to 0. However, in this specific case, the way negative variables are handled may not ensure that they are non-negative in the final solution, leading to the test failure.

To fix this, you may need to review how negative variables are treated in the optimization process and ensure that the constraints are properly enforced to guarantee non-negativity for all decision variables in the solution.
