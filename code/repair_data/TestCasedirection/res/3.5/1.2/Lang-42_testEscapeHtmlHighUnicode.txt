Analysis: The purpose of the `escape` method is to handle escaping special characters in a given string for HTML output. The method iterates over each character in the input string and writes the corresponding HTML entity for special characters or numeric entity for characters with code greater than 0x7F.

Reasons for failure:
The specific failed line `assertEquals( "High unicode was not escaped correctly", "&#119650;", escaped);` failed because the method did not correctly escape the high Unicode character U+1D362 (COUNTING ROD UNIT DIGIT THREE) as "&#119650;". The issue likely arises from how the method handles characters with code points greater than 0x7F.

To address this failure, the `escape` method should be modified to correctly handle characters with high Unicode code points by ensuring that their corresponding HTML entities are properly encoded and written to the output writer.
