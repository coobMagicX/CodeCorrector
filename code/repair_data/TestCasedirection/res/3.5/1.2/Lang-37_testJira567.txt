Analysis: The purpose of the `addAll` method is to merge two arrays of generic type `T`. The intent is to concatenate the elements of the two arrays into a new array. The failed line `n = ArrayUtils.addAll(new Integer[]{Integer.valueOf(1)}, new Long[]{Long.valueOf(2)});` failed because it is attempting to add elements of type `Long` to an array of type `Integer`, which results in an `IllegalArgumentException` being expected.

Reasons for failure: The failure is caused by an attempt to add elements of a different type (`Long`) to an array that is expected to hold a different type (`Integer`). This violates the type safety of the array and leads to the `IllegalArgumentException`. The method `addAll` does not perform type checking at runtime, and thus the error is detected only when trying to store incompatible types in the array.
