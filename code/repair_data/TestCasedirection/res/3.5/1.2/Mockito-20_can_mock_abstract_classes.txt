Analysis: The purpose of the `createMock` method is to create a mock object with specific settings and handle exceptions related to creating the mock object. In this case, the method is used to create a mock instance and set up a mockito interceptor for the instance.

The specific failed line `assertEquals("hey!", mock.getMessage());` failed in the test case `can_mock_abstract_classes` because the `mock` object did not behave as expected and did not return the expected message when `getMessage()` method was called.

Reasons for failure:
1. The mock object creation might not have been properly configured to behave as expected.
2. The settings used for creating the mock object (`withSettings().useConstructor().defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS)`) might not be compatible with the behavior expected in the test case.
3. The `AbstractMessage` class might have specific requirements that were not met during the mocking process, causing the mock object to not behave correctly.

Further investigation into the mock object creation, settings, and the behavior of `AbstractMessage` class is needed to identify the exact reasons for the failure.
