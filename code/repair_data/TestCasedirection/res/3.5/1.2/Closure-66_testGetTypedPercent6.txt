Analysis: The purpose of the failed test case `testGetTypedPercent6` is to check the percentage of typed nodes in a JavaScript code snippet. The specific line that failed is `assertEquals(100.0, getTypedPercent(js), 0.1)`.

Reason for failure: The test case failed because the `getTypedPercent` method did not return the expected value of 100.0. This indicates that the type analysis performed in the `getTypedPercent` method may not be accurately counting or calculating the percentage of typed nodes in the given JavaScript code snippet. Further investigation into the implementation of the `getTypedPercent` method is needed to identify and address the issue causing the incorrect result.
