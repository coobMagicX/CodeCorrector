Analysis: The purpose of the `toStringEquals` method is to compare the string representations of a Matcher object and another object. The specific failed line is attempting to call a method `getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes` with a List containing an Equals object and an Object array with a null value.

Reasons for failure:
1. The `getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes` method is likely expecting specific types or implementations of objects in the List and Object array. Passing a null value in the Object array might be causing an issue with the method's logic, leading to a failure.
2. The Equals(20) object in the List might not be compatible with the method's expectations, causing an error in processing the input arguments.

To resolve the failure, you should check the expected input types for the `getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes` method and ensure that the arguments passed match those expectations.
