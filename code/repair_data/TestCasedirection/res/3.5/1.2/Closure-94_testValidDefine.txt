Analysis: The purpose of the `isValidDefineValue` method is to determine whether a given node represents a valid defined value based on the token type and set of defined names. The method returns true for string literals, numbers, boolean values, valid unary and binary operations, and defined names. It returns false otherwise.

The specific failed line `assertTrue(testValidDefineValue("1 + 8"));` failed because the method does not handle the addition operation (Token.ADD) as a valid operation. The current implementation only considers certain binary and unary operators as valid, but addition is not included in the list of valid operations. Therefore, the method returns false for the addition operation, causing the test case to fail.

To fix this issue, you may need to update the `isValidDefineValue` method to handle the addition operation as a valid operation according to the requirements of your application.
