**Analysis:** The purpose of the `arrangeFF` method is to arrange blocks within a `BlockContainer` based on certain constraints and configurations. The method calculates the sizes and positions of blocks within the container according to specified rules.

The specific failed line `size = container.arrange(g2, constraint);` failed in various test cases that involved adding multiple blocks with different positions (e.g., left, right, top, bottom, center). The failures occurred when combining multiple blocks in the container, leading to incorrect width and height calculations.

**Reasons for Failure:**
1. The method does not correctly handle the arrangement of blocks when multiple blocks are added to the container with different positions simultaneously. This results in incorrect width and height calculations for the container.
2. The calculations for adjusting the positions and sizes of blocks based on the constraints and block positions are not accurately implemented, leading to wrong results in certain scenarios.
3. The logic for determining the width and height of the container based on the blocks' positions and constraints is flawed, causing the test cases to fail when verifying the expected width and height values.
