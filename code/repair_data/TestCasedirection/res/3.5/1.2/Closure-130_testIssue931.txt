Analysis: The purpose of the code is to inline aliases for certain names based on specific conditions. The failed test case indicates an issue related to collapsing properties on external types.

Reasons for failure: The specific failed line `testSame(` suggests that the test case failed at the point of trying to collapse properties on external types. This failure could be due to a mismatch between the expected behavior of collapsing properties on external types and the actual behavior implemented in the code. Further investigation and debugging are needed to identify the exact cause of this failure.
