Intent: The test case `testSuspiciousBlockCommentWarning4` intends to check whether the `handleBlockComment` method correctly identifies and reports a warning for block comments containing JSDoc-like annotations which are potentially mistaken for actual JSDoc comments due to the presence of `@` symbol in a new line within the comment block.

Repair strategy: Modify the string matching logic in the `handleBlockComment` method to correctly identify suspicious block comments that include annotations starting with `@` on new lines that are prefixed with spaces. Specifically, adjust the method to detect `@` symbols that may be preceded by one or more whitespace characters following the newline character within the block comment. This can involve using a regular expression or more sophisticated string searching method that accounts for variable whitespace.
