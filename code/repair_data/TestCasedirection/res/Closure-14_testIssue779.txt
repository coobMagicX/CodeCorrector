Intent:
The test case `testIssue779` seems designed to verify the proper handling of control flow in JavaScript code involving `try`, `if`, `finally`, and `return` statements. The test checks if all control flow paths are correctly computed and none are missing in scenarios where control might exit a block through multiple paths due to `return` statements.

Repair strategy:
The source code needs to be reviewed and possibly revised to ensure that all potential control flow paths in structures involving `try`, `if`, and `finally` blocks are correctly managed. Specifically, the handling of `return` statements within `try` and `if` blocks should be checked to ensure that control flow is accurately traced back to the caller when `return` statements are executed, especially when they are inside conditional statements within `try` blocks. Additionally, the interaction with `finally` blocks needs careful attention, as they should execute regardless of the preceding `return` statements in the `try` or `if` blocks. This might involve validating and potentially modifying the logic in the `TRY` case block of the `switch` statement in the `computeFollowNode` method to better handle scenarios with nested control structures and multiple exit points.
