Intent: The purpose of the test case `testIssue942` appears to be testing the functionality of a code formatter or minifier which takes JavaScript code as input and returns a compressed version by removing unnecessary spaces. The input "var x = {0: 1};" should be formatted to "var x={0:1};".

Repair strategy: The provided source code function `isSimpleNumber` checks if a string contains only numeric characters and starts with a non-zero digit. This function does not relate directly to formatting or minifying JavaScript code. Therefore, it seems that there might be a mix-up or confusion in the provided source code. The actual code that needs repair likely involves a function dedicated to formatting JavaScript code by removing unnecessary white spaces and possibly handling object notation formatting specifically. The repair should focus on ensuring that this function correctly identifies and removes spaces around colons and braces in object literals.
