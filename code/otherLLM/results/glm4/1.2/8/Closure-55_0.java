private static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {
    // Assuming the Node class and NodeUtil may have multiple types of nodes and NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression() only identifies if a node is a function expression
    // We need to further inspect whether it's a "reduceable" function expression.
    // This additional check could be based on specific attributes of the Node or its children that would make it reduceable.
    
    // If we have access to the type or structure of n, let's say:
    // - n.getType() returns some kind of information about the node
    // - We can also assume there is a method in NodeUtil that tells us if a function expression is "reduceable"
    
    // For example, we can modify the code like this:
    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n) && NodeUtil.isReduceable(n.getType());
