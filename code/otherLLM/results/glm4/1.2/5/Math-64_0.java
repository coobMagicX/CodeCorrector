#### b. Cost Function and Derivatives
- **Objective Function**: Ensure the objective function is implemented correctly. Use libraries like Apache Commons Math for numerical differentiation if necessary.
  
#### c. Line Search
- **Line Search Method**: Implement a robust line search method like the Fibonacci search or implement a derivative-based approach such as Armijo's rule.

#### d. Step Size Adjustment
- **Step Size Update**: Adjust step sizes based on the scaled actual reduction and predicted reduction, similar to how it is done in the provided code but ensure the logic is correct.

#### e. Orthogonality Check
- **Orthogonality Tolerance**: Add a method to check orthogonality between search direction and the current gradient, if applicable.

#### f. Relative Tolerances
- **Tolerance Checking**: Ensure that relative tolerances are being checked correctly throughout the iterations.
