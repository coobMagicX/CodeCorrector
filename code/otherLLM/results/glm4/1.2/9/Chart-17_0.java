        // Deep copy logic here. This needs to be implemented to create an independent copy of TimeSeries data.

        // - If there are arrays or collections that hold state, you need to ensure these are copied rather than referenced
        // - You might need to clone any objects contained within this object

// Usage would be as follows:
TimeSeries original = new TimeSeries();
try {

    // Now you can modify the original instance without affecting the cloned one
